From the very beginning of his academic journey at Herald \nCollege, Dhiraj found himself drawn to the world of artificial intelligence and machine \nlearning. The complexities of algorithms and the potential they held for transfo rming \nindustries fascinated him. He threw himself into his studies, devouring books, attending \nseminars, and engaging in discussions that fueled his hunger for knowledge.  \nAs Dhiraj delved deeper into his studies, he began to see the connections between AI \nand project management. He realized that AI had the power to revolutionize how projects \nwere planned, executed, and monitored. His enthusiasm caught the attention of his \nprofessors, who encouraged him to explore this intersection further.  \nDhiraj\'s passion didn\'t stop there. He had always been a creative soul, with a flair for \ndesign that he had cultivated since childhood. Recognizing the importance of a well -\ndesigned user interface in technological solutions, he decided to broaden his skill set by \nlearning about design principles and user experience.  \nHis days were a whirlwind of lectures, coding sessions, and design workshops. Dhiraj\'s \nhard work and dedication paid off, as he not only excelled in his studies but also became \nknown as someone who could bridge the gap between AI, project management, and \ndesign. His peers often sought his advice on their projects, and he was always willing to \nlend a helping hand.  \nOne day, an opportunity arose that would bring together all of Dhiraj\'s interests. A local \ntech compa ny was organizing a hackathon, inviting students from various colleges to \ncollaborate on innovative projects. Dhiraj seized this chance to showcase his skills. He \nformed a team with fellow students who shared his passion and expertise in AI, project \nmanage ment, and design.  \nTheir project was ambitious: to create an AI -driven project management tool with an \nintuitive user interface. Dhiraj\'s team worked tirelessly, brainstorming ideas, coding \nalgorithms, and refining designs. Late nights turned into early mor nings as they poured \ntheir hearts into their creation.  \nThe day of the hackathon arrived, and Dhiraj\'s team presented their project to a panel of \njudges and a captivated audience. The tool seamlessly integrated AI algorithms to predict \nproject timelines, al locate resources efficiently, and generate real -time progress reports. \nThe elegant design and user -friendly interface were a testament to Dhiraj\'s commitment \nto all aspects of his expertise.  \nThe judges were impressed not only by the innovation but also by the teamwork and \npassion that radiated from Dhiraj and his team. When the results were announced, they \nwere greeted with thunderous applause – Dhiraj\'s team had won first place.  The victory was a validation of Dhiraj\'s journey at Herald College. It was a c elebration of \nhis dedication to AI, machine learning, project management, and design. But beyond the \naccolades, Dhiraj knew that this was just the beginning. He had proven to himself and the \nworld that with the right combination of passion and skill, he co uld make a meaningful \nimpact on the technological landscape.  \nAs he walked out of the hackathon venue, Dhiraj couldn\'t help but feel a sense of pride \nand excitement for what lay ahead. The journey he had embarked upon at Herald College \nwas a testament to hi s unwavering determination and his ability to integrate multiple \ndisciplines into a cohesive vision. And so, with the city of Kathmandu as his backdrop, \nDhiraj\'s story continued to unfold, full of promise and endless possibilities.  \n ', 'Dhiraj\'s team created an AI-driven project management tool.

Due to the large amount of data, individuals and organizations face the challenges of managing vast amounts of textual data, including lengthy documents, research papers, and articles. Extracting essential insights from these documents is a time consuming and resource intensive task. The proposed document summarization tool aims to address the problem by leveraging NLP and machine learning techniques. \r\n\r\nProject Title\r\n\r\nDocument to Text Summarization using Machine Learning\r\n\r\nAcademic Question\r\n\r\nHow does the tool address the problem of information and time-consuming content review?\r\n\r\nWhat are the potential benefits of using NLP and machine learning algorithms in the summarization process?\r\n\r\nWhat existing NLP algorithms and approaches will be used to automate the text summarization?\r\n\r\nWhat techniques will be used to handle document parsing and processing for document format (e.g., PDF)?\r\n\r\nAims and Objectives\r\n\r\nAims\r\n\r\nTo develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based document summarization model.\r\n\r\nTo create a tool for summarizing lengthy documents, research papers, and articles.\r\n\r\nTo provide the users with concise summaries for improved content comprehension.\r\n\r\nTo improve efficiency in learning and reading contents.\r\n\r\nTo save time and increase interest in reading document-based contents.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\nA web application will be created that will allow users to input documents and get summaries generated.\r\n\r\nNatural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy technology will be used to handle document parsing and processing for various formats.\r\n\r\nA suitable Natural Language Processing (NLP) summarization model will be chosen.\r\n\r\nThe summarized set of documents will then be stored in the database from the documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem Statement\r\n\r\nDue to the expansion in digital information, a challenge of information overloading has been seen. Dealing with lengthy documents and research materials becomes time consuming, hindering the ability to extract crucial information quickly. A study published in Nature Communication reveals that our collective attention span is narrowing. This is not just on social media but also in different domains, that people are losing their attention span (Lorenz-Spreen, et al., 2019). Due to the low attention span, most individuals are not likely to read journals, books, and other documented files. The rise of audio-visual content has also impacted the consumption of text-based information. These days the way of consuming information has changed which is a positive thing but in context of a person with academic background in performing research based on text-based documents, one of the pain-points I have been facing is analyzing and curating the contents from lengthy documents. In the professional world, handling and extracting major key points from proposals and documents could be a terrible task for working individuals until there is a summarization tool that makes the task easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject as Solution\r\n\r\nProfessionals, researchers, and students face challenges of extracting content from research papers and journals. This summarization tool will extract important insights from a paper to make informed decisions quickly. Dealing with lengthy documents that require significant time and effort is a terrible task, the project will be able to minimize the time required and will prioritize important documents. This tool will help streamline the process of summarizing and aggregating information from multiple sources and will store it for further usage of the user. People will be able to access necessary content in a short format, saving time. It will encourage continuous learning by allowing users to explore a broader range of topics within a shorter time frame.\r\n\r\nScope and Limitations\r\n\r\nScope \r\n\r\nThe major scope of this application is that it can summarize pdf-based documents including research papers, articles, and textual content. \r\n\r\nIt will be able to identify key points, findings, and contextual information from lengthy documents.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nSummarization algorithms may not capture the complete context of a document.\r\n\r\nThe tool will be limited to cross-language summarization feature.\r\n\r\nThe tool focuses on text-based documents and may not be able to effectively handle images, charts, and videos.\r\n\r\nThe summarizer might be limited to certain word count.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial Research\r\n\r\nHugging Face\r\n\r\nHugging Face is a platform for data science and machine learning which was initially developed in 2017 as a chatbot app for teenagers but has expanded its domain from just a chatbot app. This platform has a range of functionalities from creating, hosting, and managing their own AI models to engaging in discussions and collaborations within the platform. Hugging face also holds a substantial collection of models and datasets created by the collaborators and users. This platform encompasses a range of AI applications like computer vision, audio analysis, and natural language processing (Rebelo, 2023).\r\n\r\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\r\n\r\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a division of AI that aims to make computers comprehend, analyze, and produce human language. NLP plays and significant role in extracting the most meaningful information. NLP encompasses various techniques and methods to process and understand human language. The division of NLP approaches extractive and abstractive summarization, along with other categories such as single-document, multi-document, and query-based summarization.\r\n\r\nAbstractive Summarization\r\n\r\nAbstractive summarization is a method where the generated summary doesn’t necessarily consist of sentences present in the original text, instead it creates new sentences that capture the key concepts. This is a approach where the new texts are generated only after abstracting and understanding the semantic meaning of the text while capturing the key concepts of the original content.\r\n\r\nExtractive Summarization \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Extractive summarization involves choosing sentences directly from the source text to create a concise summarization. Then the chosen text based content is typically chosen based on its importance and relevance. This method aims to retain the original wording from the text, making it more conservative approach to summarization (Adhikari, et al., 2020). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature Review\r\n\r\nNLP Based Text Summarization Using Semantic Analysis (Moiyadi, et al., 2016)\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nText Summarization is a supervised learning method that heavily relies on Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps in generating concise and comprehensive summaries from a massive number of text-based inputs. \r\n\r\nThis literature review focuses on the research paper titled “NLP Based Text Summarization Using Semantic Analysis” which introduces an innovative approach for specific text summarization. To save manual effort in information processing, the study discusses the challenges of summarizing large texts and highlights the use of automatic summarization tools. The author offers a method based on Semantic Analysis, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps in extracting representative sentences and generates meaningful summaries.\r\n\r\nMethodology \r\n\r\nThe proposed methodology in this research paper leverages a technique based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for summarizing text-based data. LSA is used to extract semantically important sentences and generate the summary of the input text. Firstly, the input document undergoes a data preprocessing method, where irrelevant words such as stop, words are removed to enhance the quality of the summary. A matrix of word counts is constructed from preprocessed text, representing the occurrence of words across sentences. The sentence matrix undergoes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce dimensionality and identify the latent semantic structure of the text. This helps in identifying the most noticeable feature of the document, enabling extraction of meaningful sentences for summary. Based on latent semantic structure, the system identifies the most relevant sentence and arranges them in a coherent manner to generate the final summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1 Proposed System (Moiyadi, et al., 2016)\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe authors applied LSA-based summarization techniques to a diverse set of texts and evaluated the performance of generated summaries. They measured the quality of the summaries using various metrics, including ROUGE scores, F1-score, and precision-recall curves. The study indicates that the LSA approach performed better than existing summarization techniques. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctional Decomposition Diagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2 Functional Decomposition Diagram of the system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtifacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed artifacts outline the components and features for document to text summarization system. The system comprises different subsystems, each with specific functionalities.\r\n\r\nFrontend Subsystem\r\n\r\nUser Registration\r\n\r\nThis will be the first user interaction, which will allow the user to register by creating a user account and login with their credentials. Here, the user needs to provide their basic information to access the system.\r\n\r\nDocument Upload\r\n\r\nUsers can interact with the system by uploading documents they wish to summarize. This feature provides users to input the documents into the system.\r\n\r\nSummary Display\r\n\r\nAfter the document is uploaded, this feature will play an important role in displaying the summarized data to the user.\r\n\r\nNLP Subsystem\r\n\r\nAPI Based Summarizer\r\n\r\nThis functionality will integrate an external summarization API from hugging face or any reliable source which will allow summarizing any kind of documents.\r\n\r\nCustom Summarizer\r\n\r\nThis system will be trained with custom data especially for a specific kind of text-based file such as book and will summarize the contents based on its specific feature.\r\n\r\nBackend Subsystem\r\n\r\nDatabase Management\r\n\r\nThe system will use MariaDB to manage data storage and will be storing user information, uploaded documents and generated summaries allowing the users to access and review the summaries of their uploaded documents whenever they need.\r\n\r\nAPI Management \r\n\r\nThis functionality will be involved in managing the data fetched from the API and will be helping in allowing the external summarization API. \r\n\r\nSoftware Development Methodology \r\n\r\nTo organize the software development cycle, Kanban Methodology will be used. Kanban is a method used to manage and optimize workflows in project management by emphasizing visual work, limiting work in progress, and promoting continuous improvement. Choosing Kanban for individual software development offers distinct advantages over other SDLC methodologies. Kanban allows high flexibility as it deals with prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency since solo developers often face quick change in priority. It encourages a constant flow of deliverables leading to quicker feedback. It allows individual developers to manage their work in a way that suits their own pace and style, as it does not have a predefined iteration like Scrum, allowing them not to spend time on detailed planning sessions or assigning tasks (Raut, 2015). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3 A glimpse to Trello\r\n\r\nTrello will be utilized to follow the Kanban method, utilizing its visual card-based system for effective task and project management. Trello was launched in 2011, attributed to user friendly design and adaptability which helped it in gaining popularity. In Trello, the tasks are visualized as cards or sticky notes on a visual board which is kanban and, usually divided into columns that represent different stages of the workflow, such as ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’ and ‘Done’. These cards are movable across the columns to reflect the progress of the work (Johnson, 2021). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4 Work Breakdown Structure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGantt Chart\r\n\r\nBelow is a proposed Gantt Chart of the overall timeline of the project. Here the project timeline is divided into six phases. The first phase is the phase of project initiation where the requirement gathering, research and proposal is prepared for the project. Based on the first phase the second phase starts with the basic visualization of the overall system through wireframing and creating the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of the system. After this, the phase of development kicks off with the integration of API in a crude system without a frontend. The evaluation of the API system will be conducted and then the NLP model will be developed which includes the preprocessing, model architecture design, model training, and fine tuning of the system. The model will then be displayed after the front-end development and the backend development will help in setting up the backend with database integration. Finally, a final documentation of the whole project will be done accordingly as shown in the Gantt Chart below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5 Gantt Chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTools and Technology\r\n\r\nHTML/ CSS/ JS \r\n\r\nHTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for front-end development for this system, where HTML helps in structuring the content where CSS helps in defining the visual representation of the HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and attractive design. Similarly, JavaScript helps in adding interactivity, enabling dynamic content updates and enhancing the user engagement.\r\n\r\nDjango Framework \r\n\r\nDjango Framework was chosen for backend due to my familiarity with Python language. Django is known for its effectiveness in handling web applications. It is a free and open-source web framework for Python that accelerates the development of web applications. It offers a more effective method to build and develop web programs that initiating from scratch because it removes the need to build the backend, APIs, JavaScript (IBM, 2023). \r\n\r\nMariaDB \r\n\r\nTo store the data, MariaDB will be used due to its user-friendly interface simplifies database management, making it an excellent choice for an uncomplicated database solution. \r\n\r\nNLP Model \r\n\r\nNLP model is the proposed model that will be used for the machine learning aspect of the system. TextRank is one of the algorithms that extracts important sentences from a document. Similarly for the proposed system, transformer-based models such as BERT and BART could be used for abstractive summarization (Pietro, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\n\r\nAdhikari, S., M. & R., 2020.

institutions that have played an important role in the successful initiation of the final year project.This literature review focuses on the research paper titled “NLP Based Text Summarization Using Semantic Analysis” which introduces an innovative approach for specific text summarization.Project Title\r\n\r\nDocument to Text Summarization using Machine Learning\r\n\r\nAcademic Question\r\n\r\nHow does the tool address the problem of information and time-consuming content review?Abstractive Summarization\r\n\r\nAbstractive summarization is a method where the generated summary doesn’t necessarily consist of sentences present in the original text, instead it creates new sentences that capture the key concepts.These days the way of consuming information has changed which is a positive thing but in context of a person with academic background in performing research based on text-based documents, one of the pain-points I have been facing is analyzing and curating the contents from lengthy documents.Extractive Summarization \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Extractive summarization involves choosing sentences directly from the source text to create a concise summarization.Functional Decomposition Diagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2 Functional Decomposition Diagram of the system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtifacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed artifacts outline the components and features for document to text summarization system.The project imposes the development of a web-based platform that encompasses a range of functionalities to simplify the summarization process including user registration, document upload, summary display.Based on the first phase the second phase starts with the basic visualization of the overall system through wireframing and creating the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of the system.Dealing with lengthy documents that require significant time and effort is a terrible task, the project will be able to minimize the time required and will prioritize important documents.NLP Subsystem\r\n\r\nAPI Based Summarizer\r\n\r\nThis functionality will integrate an external summarization API from hugging face or any reliable source which will allow summarizing any kind of documents.In the professional world, handling and extracting major key points from proposals and documents could be a terrible task for working individuals until there is a summarization tool that makes the task easier.Aims and Objectives\r\n\r\nAims\r\n\r\nTo develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based document

Despite challenges in planning, securing sponsorships, and logistical coordination, the project successfully executed its initiatives. Valuable lessons in effective planning, teamwork, and the importance of gratitude were gleaned from this experience. The outcomes were significant, including heightened awareness of menstrual hygiene, the establishment of a functional library, provision of extracurricular opportunities, improved student attendance, and the establishment of valuable partnerships with businesses. The project also significantly contributed to the CSR initiatives of the supporting organizations. Sponsors and partners including Mahalaxmi Bikas Bank, Garima Bikas Bank, and Buddha Publications played an indispensable role in the project\'s success, while the unwavering support of the school administration was instrumental in achieving the project\'s objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Social Experience Project stands as a testament to the impact that dedicated students can have in underprivileged communities. Through a blend of determination, teamwork, and invaluable support from sponsors and the school administration, the project successfully addressed critical needs and left a lasting positive mark on Shree Bhagwati Secondary School and its students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1\r\n\r\n1.1 Introduction to Organization\r\n\r\nShree Bhagwati Secondary School, a government school nestled in the heart of Gulmi, Nepal. It is situated in Arbeni, Kaligandaki Gaupalika-02. The school was established in 2017 B.S.The school has a total of two hundred and eighteen students. The school is highly committed to improve itself with necessary actions with the main objective of improving the quality of education day by day. Through this project we are committed to assist the school in integrating some essential elements that will improve the quality of education.\r\n\r\n1.2 Reasons for Selection\r\n\r\nBy interacting with community leaders and local residents of Gulmi, Shree Bhagwati Secondary School came to our attention, as they are closely connected with the ground realities and are aware of the institutions that require aid.\r\n\r\nLack of Educational Resources\r\n\r\nAwareness of Menstrual Hygiene\r\n\r\nInclusive Approach to Education\r\n\r\nLimited Sports Infrastructure\r\n\r\nInadequate Clean Water Facilities\r\n\r\nIn summary, Shree Bhagwati Secondary School was selected due to its evident needs in various sectors like education, physical well-being and basic amenities. Project Paribhasa, through SEP, identified these gaps and tailored its activities to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the school\'s infrastructure and its students\' lives.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND TASKS DONE DURING SEP\r\n\r\n2.1 INTRODUCTION OF THE ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThrough SEP, Project Paribhasa aimed to conduct various activities that were focused on the students of different grades at Shree Bhagwati Secondary School. Book donation and library setup, menstrual hygiene session along with pad donation to female students and to the school, donation of different types of sports materials to the school and lastly donation of a water tank and a purifier were some of the major events we performed there.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES PERFORMED:\r\n\r\nBook Donations and Library Setup\r\n\r\nThrough this program, we donated books that were helpful for students from grade 1 to grade 12 for their betterment. Along with the donation of books we also helped the school set up the library as it really needed some change. We donated the books to the principal of the school. The main objective of this program was to help every student get access to good books and to equal knowledge and provide a clean and friendly space to learn and study.\r\n\r\nMenstrual Hygiene and Pad Donation\r\n\r\nThe main objective behind this session was to provide knowledge regarding why women menstruate, what they should do, how to take care of themselves and other general facts regarding menstruation. The participants in this session were the students of grade 8,9,10,11 and 12. \r\n\r\nWe started the session by discussing what menstruation is, why they happen, and then we started discussing sanitary pads, how to wear them, how to dispose of them properly and then the discussion went on regarding the myths and facts about menstruation. We also discussed the importance of nutrition, yoga while menstruating. In the session, male students were also present and were openly discussing and sharing their experiences and teachers were involved and quite supportive during the session. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the session, we distributed pads to every female student present there and then we donated the remaining pads to the school. And to the male participants of the session, we gave them copies to appreciate their presence and their participation.  In total, we donated 100 pads to the school so that the students could get access to clean and safe sanitary pads in the school itself. \r\n\r\nDonation of sports materials\r\n\r\n             When we had a conversation with the school representative, we got to know that the students did not have enough sports equipment to play in the school, thus we decided to donate various types of sports materials to the school. We donated chess boards, ludo, football, volleyball, badminton rackets. The materials were handed over to the school’s vice principal. And after the donation, we asked the respective authority to allow the students to have a little play time where the students had a great time playing different types of games. We played games like musical balls and we gave the winners some copies and the rest were given to the school itself so that it could be provided to the needy students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDonation of Water Tank and Purifier\r\n\r\n           The major program of Project Paribhasa was the donation of a water tank and a purifier because we were told that the school does not have a proper tap allocated for drinking water. And that it was one of the major requirements of the school. There was only a pipe for drinking water and the students were not satisfied with it. Therefore, with the motive of providing clean drinking water to the 215 students of Shree Bhagawati Secondary School, we donated a 1000 liter water tank and a water purifier to the school. This really made a positive impact on the students and the school.\r\n\r\n2.2 PROCEDURES OF THE TASKS PERFORMED\r\n\r\nThe entire process required and done for the completion of Project Paribhasa’s programs can be classified into the following important steps:\r\n\r\nSelection of the school\r\n\r\n              The very first step of SEP was to find a school where some help and assistance was required. We were actually looking for a school where we could really make an impact and create a difference through our programs. Therefore, our search stopped when we got to know about Shree Bhagawati Secondary School located in Arbeni, Kaligandaki Gaupalika-2, Gulmi. \r\n\r\nCommunication\r\n\r\n            The next step after selecting the school was to set up objectives and goals that we had to achieve. But before that, we also had to know about the necessities of the children at the school. Therefore, Project Paribhasa was in constant contact with the school Principal to know about the student\'s requirements and in what ways we could be helpful. Through continuous communication, we were able to know about the lack of sports materials, and lack of access to clean drinking water.  Because of communication, we were able to complete our project as well as address the student’s needs in an effective way. And it turned out to be really helpful for both parties\r\n\r\nSponsorship\r\n\r\n             After learning about the requirements at the school, we started to search for sponsors who were willing to help us complete our project and help the students in Gulmi. For this, we started contacting the potential sponsors via email, calls, and personal contacts. We did not receive the anticipated responses yet we were supported by our three sponsors to whom we are really grateful. Garima Bikas Bank, Mahalaxmi Bikas Bank and Buddha Publication were our finalized sponsors who supported our project and helped make impacts in the lives of the 215 students of Shree Bhagwati Secondary School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned were the major procedures for the completion of the tasks performed during our SEP. After the materials were collected and bought, we headed towards our destination, and then we started to work as per mentioned in 2.1. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nLEARNINGS, CHALLENGES, AND OUTCOMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1 LEARNINGS\r\n\r\nThe Social Experience Project has been one of the most fruitful projects of our educational life where we got the opportunity to lively interact with people from rural areas, to know about their culture and traditions, their way of life and many more. There are a lot of learnings that can be listed but we would like to list the major ones which are elaborated under:\r\n\r\na. Proper planning and organization\r\n\r\nb. Team work\r\n\r\nc. Sponsorships\r\n\r\nd. Taking care of your belongings\r\n\r\ne. Managerial skills\r\n\r\nf. Compassion is really important\r\n\r\ng. Gratefulness in what we have\r\n\r\nWithin the duration of this project, the time spent at Shree Bhagwati Secondary School was beyond any imagination and expectations. This project has taught us that planning is not important in just theories that we\'ve learned but in practical life too. To manage and organize a set of activities need a proper planning and well scheduled timeline as we did from deciding in advance which organization should we choose to work on to companies to approach for sponsorships and delegating tasks to each member. Related to planning, the program has also given the opportunity to excel and practice our managerial skills. We interacted with the Red Cross Society members, school principal, village head, teachers, staff and most importantly the children there in the class. Similarly, it gave us a platform to lead the topics we delivered to the children. \r\n\r\nBy far the most important lesson that we learned during the entire Social Experience\r\n\r\nProject is ‘Teamwork’. We worked together from planning to execution and controlling the entire\r\n\r\nset of activities we did. It taught us a valuable lesson that success cannot be achieved in isolation.\r\n\r\nComparing the lives that we live here in Kathmandu valley as a student of KUSOM and\r\n\r\nthe life they lived there as the locals of Gulmi were drastically different from each other which taught us the importance of being grateful for what we have and to be compassionate with everyone. The bumpy roads, however beautiful the experience, subsistence food but tasty, poor accommodation but warm bonding among the Red Cross Society members were the unforgettable experience we had. These experiences also come up with a bundle of learnings that are not just applicable in our professional life but play an equal role in personal life and being a responsible citizen of the country.\r\n\r\n3.2 CHALLENGES\r\n\r\nThere are challenges in every step of our lives and overcoming them and moving forward is what makes the journey precious and memorable. We also faced several challenges while executing the Social Experience Program which we have explained below:\r\n\r\nPlanning and Coordinating: Although there were no issues with and among our team, the only problem was that we were not able to sit together and start planning and coordinating for the project because of our final examination of Semester 4. As this project was something we had never done before, coming up with a perfect plan to execute this project and make it successful was also very challenging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding Sponsors: The objective of our project was not only to provide literacy and\r\n\r\nawareness sessions to the students, but it was also to help them with some stationery and\r\n\r\nExtracurricular Activities (ECA)  items and books for the library at the school, which would not be possible without the management of funds for which we had to find the sponsors. We also came across various challenges while communicating with sponsors and managing the required letters.\r\n\r\nComing up with the Content: It was difficult for us to come up with appropriate content for the awareness program part of our project due to the cultural differences. Menstrual hygiene awareness program, however, was a very successful program, more successful than we had thought.\r\n\r\nManaging Accommodation and Transportation: One of the biggest challenges for us was finding a suitable place for us to stay during the execution of the project. Since we were not familiar with the place that we were visiting for the project, we didn’t have any idea about where we would be staying. We also had a huge challenge of taking all the donation items (stationery items, ECA items, books, sanitary pads, etc.) with us because there were too many items along with our luggage and managing the vehicle was very important. In fact, the group had to walk for about an hour and a half every day to go to the school and return to the place of the accommodation. \r\n\r\nMaking Sessions Productive: The main aim of our project was to give insightful and useful sessions related to menstrual hygiene. But just delivering the contents of the sessions would not be productive. We had to make sure that the students were actually understanding every content that we were delivering. However, the students turned out to be very shy at first which made the initial part of the sessions less interactive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccommodation and Food: The traditional home that we stayed in lacked modern comforts, basic sanitation, and easy access to clean drinking water. The food variety was also restricted to local produce, and the absence of cooking facilities created logistical issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite all these challenges present while conducting our SEP, we thoroughly\r\n\r\nenjoyed every bit of it while working together as a team and finding out ways to resolve and\r\n\r\novercome them.\r\n\r\n3.3 OUTCOMES\r\n\r\nSome of the outcomes from this project are listed as follows;\r\n\r\nStudents, even the boys, got an in-depth overview of menstrual hygiene.\r\n\r\nLibrary setup to make sure that the students will not have to limit their knowledge.\r\n\r\nSetting up Extra Curricular time, for students to engage in activities beyond studies.\r\n\r\nIncreased motivation of students to come to the schools, due to the availability of the\r\n\r\nsports items, donated by Team Paribhasa leading to lesser number of absentees.\r\n\r\nBegining of discussion on sensitive topics like safe menstrual hygiene.\r\n\r\nFacilitating students of the rural part of Nepal to participate in events which were being held in urban schools of Kathmandu Valley.\r\n\r\nFurthering the relationship between KUSOM and different business houses through\r\n\r\nsuccessful sponsorship collaborations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n                Project Paribhasa would not have been able to help the school and its students if not for the sponsors who assisted and supported us and made it so much easier for us. We would like to extend a hearty thanks and appreciation  to our sponsors: Garima Bikas Bank, Mahalaxmi Bikas Bank and Buddha Publications. With your generous support we were able to complete our project successfully and bring smiles to the faces of 215 students of Shree Bhagwati Secondary School. It would have been almost impossible to complete SEP without their assistance. Thus, we are very much grateful towards our generous sponsors.\r\n\r\n                Along with our sponsors we also want to extend our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the school and to the school administration who were kind enough to help us and cooperate with us which made our tasks so much easier. Without their support, we would not have been able to fulfill the student\'s needs and be as impactful as we were able to with their full support. We are also grateful to the school for making us feel so welcomed and comfortable. We will never forget their kindness and warm gestures towards us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2', 'Table of Contents\r\n\r\n	Abstract	1\r\n\r\n	CHAPTER 1	2\r\n\r\n	1.1 Introduction to Organization	2\r\n\r\n	1.2 Reasons for Selection	2\r\n\r\n	CHAPTER 2	3\r\n\r\n	ACTIVITIES AND TASKS DONE DURING SEP	3\r\n\r\n	2.1 INTRODUCTION OF THE ACTIVITIES	3\r\n\r\n	ACTIVITIES PERFORMED:	3\r\n\r\n	2.2 PROCEDURES OF THE TASKS PERFORMED	5\r\n\r\n	CHAPTER 3	7\r\n\r\n	LEARNINGS, CHALLENGES, AND OUTCOMES	7\r\n\r\n	3.1 LEARNINGS	7\r\n\r\n	3.2 CHALLENGES	8\r\n\r\n	3.3 OUTCOMES	10\r\n\r\n	CONCLUSION	11\r\n\r\n	Appendix	12\r\n\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe Social Experience Project, led by Bachelor of Business Administration students, sought to uplift Shree Bhagwati Secondary School in Gulmi, Nepal, addressing critical areas such as educational resources, menstrual hygiene awareness, inclusive education, sports facilities, and access to clean water.Book donation and library setup, menstrual hygiene session along with pad donation to female students and to the school, donation of different types of sports materials to the school and lastly donation of a water tank and a purifier were some of the major events we performed there.Donation of sports materials\r\n\r\n             When we had a conversation with the school representative, we got to know that the students did not have enough sports equipment to play in the school, thus we decided to donate various types of sports materials to the school.Finding Sponsors: The objective of our project was not only to provide literacy and\r\n\r\nawareness sessions to the students, but it was also to help them with some stationery and\r\n\r\nExtracurricular Activities (ECA)  items and books for the library at the school, which would not be possible without the management of funds for which we had to find the sponsors.Along with our sponsors we also want to extend our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the school and to the school administration who were kind enough to help us and cooperate with us which made our tasks so much easier.CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n                Project Paribhasa would not have been able to help the school and its students if not for the sponsors who assisted and supported us and made it so much easier for us.Through a blend of determination, teamwork, and invaluable support from sponsors and the school administration, the project successfully addressed critical needs and left a lasting positive mark on Shree Bhagwati Secondary School and its students.And it turned out to be really helpful for both parties\r\n\r\nSponsorship\r\n\r\n             After learning about the requirements at the school, we started to search for sponsors who were willing to help us complete our project and help the students in Gulmi.Therefore, with the motive of providing clean drinking water to the 215 students of Shree Bhagawati Secondary School, we donated a 1000 liter water tank and a water purifier to the school.2.2 PROCEDURES OF THE TASKS PERFORMED\r\n\r\nThe entire process required and done for the completion of Project Paribhasa’s programs can be classified into the following important steps:\r\n\r\nSelection of the school\r\n\r\n              The very first step of SEP was to find a school where some help and assistance was required.In total, we donated 100 pads to the school so that the students could get access to clean and safe sanitary pads in the school itself.A Social Experience Project by\r\n\r\nProject Paribhasa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup Members\r\n\r\nRiwaz Joshi\r\n\r\nOscar Koirala\r\n\r\nAyusha Bhattarai\r\n\r\nMimisara Thapa \r\n\r\nAaryan Kuikel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrepared for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement\r\n\r\nAs Bachelor of Business Administration students, this report was assigned to us as a compulsory project during our third year.', 0, 'project-paribhasadocx', '2023-12-21 12:18:01', '2024-02-09 19:58:54'),

It aims to create a 3D platform open-world game named “Fractured Memories”. This open-world adventure game re-unities the mission of the family, the characters will have to survive in the wild with some skills and their available resources. This project focuses on a dynamic environment. The game has a realistic feature of change in time and weather of the game environment. The narrative will evolve alongside the changing time and weather. Within this game the player will be able to interact and collect the resources available. The game will consist of Non-Pedestrian Characters (NPCs) making the game more realistic. \r\n\r\nThe targeted audience for this game primarily consists of individuals who have a keen interest in open-world gaming experiences, particularly within the survival game genre. The game will cater to a sense of freedom and exploration, allowing players to interact with the dynamic and unpredictable virtual world. This is the proposed overview of the game where the players can also gather things available, and based on different tactics the player needs to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims and Objectives\r\n\r\nAims\r\n\r\nThe player can feel nature and enjoy the gameplay without any restrictions.\r\n\r\nThis game will help the player to know the survival and crafting skills which can be related in the real world.\r\n\r\nThis game also has some quests and missions which will help to increase the general knowledge and IQ of the player.\r\n\r\nThe game can help in releasing stress and improve self-satisfaction on winning different stages of the game.\r\n\r\nThe game will help players to live a life inside an environment where they can experience a world they would enjoy. \r\n\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nTo provide the player with the opportunity to play the game with their own choices whether they want to continue the mission or explore the world.\r\n\r\nTo develop a 3D open world game using Unity and Blender.\r\n\r\nTo implement a realistic environment where the player can experience day, night, and season change.\r\n\r\nTo implement survival tactics and character growth in the game while playing and experiencing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem Statement\r\n\r\nGame enthusiasts face device compatibility issues since different platforms may have different specifications which can lead to difficulties in making games work consistently across different platforms. The gamers do want to experience a game that can help boost their mood and help them to tackle stress, loneliness, and depression. The game that has been proposed will help players to interact in an open world. Players do enjoy a game where they are free to do anything. This gives them a sense of freedom and joy in exploration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject as Solution\r\n\r\nAs the character progresses through the story, the skills and ability of the character will develop, providing players feel like they made progress and achieved something in the real-world. This game will motivate the player to explore the expansive world of the game, discovering hidden locations and exciting encounters. Lastly, this game will deliver some feelings of importance, loss, love, and happiness to the player.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScope and Limitations\r\n\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThis is an open-world game, the player will have freedom to make significant decisions that will impact the gameplay and can explore the world without any restrictions.\r\n\r\nA game for gamers with low specifications computer interested in open world games.\r\n\r\nDuring the gameplay, the player might get stuck at some point if the character is unable to solve the quests which may decrease the interest of continuing the game. Also, some unidentified bugs may also ruin the gameplay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nAlthough this is an offline story-based game, we can still face the optimization issues for the less powerful system of the player.\r\n\r\nBudget constraints may affect the ability to acquire assets like trees, cars, and other environmental elements in the developmental phase.\r\n\r\nAs an individual developer, challenges in debugging, identifying the bugs and glitches can be time consuming and complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature Review\r\n\r\nThe Development of 3D Survival Simulation Game for Identifying Safe Food and Water in Borneo Forest (Kurniawan, et al., 2020)\r\n\r\nTraditional methods of teaching survival skills, especially the ability to identify safe food and water in challenging environments often rely on verbal approaches, which may not properly convey practical information to students. Researchers have investigated the use of games as an alternative and useful learning medium to address this restriction, particularly simulation games. This literature review aims to examine the development and effectiveness of a 3D survival simulation game designed to teach players how to identify safe food and water in the Borneo Forest.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this game was developed based on the learning material, teaching method, gameplay, setting, and plot. The main scenario of this game is Borneo Island, known for rich flora and natural beauty, making it an ideal location for adventure. The research aimed to address this issue by using a simulation game to help players distinguish between edible and toxic substances. \r\n\r\nThe game involves four missions, each increasing in complexity and difficulty. These missions teach players different techniques for identifying safe food and water, such as recognizing plant characteristics and performing irritation testing. In the material collection stage, the researchers collected images, 3D objects with textures, 3D characters, audio, and animations needed for the game. Most 3D assets were obtained from Unity Assets Store, and any necessary modifications were made using Blender. The assembly stage involved the actual game development using Unity game engine and Visual Studio as a source code editor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtifacts\r\n\r\n3D Assets\r\n\r\n3D assets include the characters, vehicles, buildings, objects, trees, and other visible game objects that the player will be able to see while playing the game.\r\n\r\nUI/ UX\r\n\r\nThis will help in the interaction of the player character model with the 3D assets that are available in the environment.\r\n\r\nAudio Assets\r\n\r\nThe audio effects such as in game interaction sound, realistic player movement sound, the sound of vehicles and background music will be the artifacts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware Development Methodology\r\n\r\nSoftware development methodology is a structured and organized process of developing high-quality software quickly and efficiently. The development phase consists of different stages from problem identification, planning, designing, building/ developing, testing, and then deploying the final product. The whole process in software development methodology is called Software Development Life Cycle. SDLC aims to avoid common mistakes in the development phase. The common SDLC models are waterfall method, spiral method, agile method (Alexandra, 2023). \r\n\r\nTo seamlessly track and manage this project, Kanban methodology for software development will be followed. Kanban is a term from the Japan that means billboard or signboard. The kanban methodology signifies its meaning as the major principle of Kanban is to visualize the work status and progress using the boards. Instead of dividing the work in teams, the stakeholder can add request to the backlogs. Kanban and Scrum are two agile approaches where Kanban doesn’t define roles focusing on cycle whereas scrum has fixed length sprints, specific roles (Mijacobs, et al., 2022).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTools and Technologies\r\n\r\nUnity\r\n\r\nUnity is a powerful tool used by many game developers to create and enhance their games. It is a game engine that provides tools for creating the core functionality of games and serves as an integrated development environment (IDE), helping in coding, designing, and managing the game elements. Some of the games made with Unity are Temple Run, Monument Valley, Ori and the Blind Forest and many more (Sinicki, 2021).\r\n\r\nBlender \r\n\r\nBlender is a free and opensource software that helps in creating 2D and 3D elements, characters and many other objects that require 2D or 3D modeling. Blender is mostly used in video, filmmaking, game development, architecture. Blender will be used to animate the characters and design the models and assets of the game environment.\r\n\r\nPhotoshop\r\n\r\nAdobe Photoshop is a software that is mostly used for editing, manipulating the photos and graphical contents. It is used by designers, photographers, artists, and other creative background individuals. In this project, photoshop will be used to create the buttons and images used in the game. \r\n\r\nVS Code\r\n\r\nVS Code is a code editor software developed by Microsoft. This is a good choice to interpret codes due to tis extensibility, flexibility, and many features that help coding seamlessly.\r\n\r\nC#\r\n\r\nC# programming language will be used as the fundamental game development language helping in implementing game logic with high efficiency. It can be utilized in the Unity Game Engine for scripting, offering the ability to implement game logic, physics, user interaction, and more (Kamau, 2021). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the proposed project aims to create an engaging open-world 3D platform game that immerses players in dynamic and unpredictable virtual worlds. By offering freedom of choice and exploration, the game seeks to cater to diverse audiences, impact survival and crafting skills, and enhance players critical thinking ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\n\r\nA., 2023.

Despite challenges in planning, securing sponsorships, and logistical \r\ncoordination, the project successfully executed its initiatives. Valuable lessons in effective \r\nplanning, teamwork, and the importance of gra titude were gleaned from this experience. The \r\noutcomes were significant, including heightened awareness of menstrual hygiene, the \r\nestablishment of a functional library, provision of extracurricular opportunities, improved student \r\nattendance, and the establ ishment of valuable partnerships with businesses. The project also \r\nsignificantly contributed to the CSR initiatives of the supporting organizations. Sponsors and \r\npartners including Mahalaxmi Bikas Bank, Garima Bikas Bank, and Buddha Publications played \r\nan indispensable role in the project\'s success, while the unwavering support of the school \r\nadministration was instrumental in achieving the project\'s objectives.  \r\n \r\nIn conclusion, the Social Experience Project stands as a testament to the impact that \r\ndedicated students can have in underprivileged communities. Through a blend of determination, \r\nteamwork, and invaluable support from sponsors and the school administration , the project \r\nsuccessfully addressed critical needs and left a lasting positive mark on Shree Bhagwati Secondary \r\nSchool and its students.  \r\n \r\n 2 \r\n CHAPTER 1  \r\n1.1 Introduction to Organization  \r\nShree Bhagwati Secondary School, a government school nestled in \r\nthe heart of Gulmi, Nepal. It is situated in Arbeni, Kaligandaki Gaupalika -\r\n02. The school was established in 2017 B.S.The school has a total of two \r\nhundred and eighteen students. The school is  highly committed to improve \r\nitself with necessary actions with the main objective of improving the quality of education day by \r\nday. Through this project we are committed to assist the school in integrating some essential \r\nelements that will improve the qua lity of education.  \r\n1.2 Reasons for Selection  \r\nBy interacting with community leaders and local residents of Gulmi, Shree Bhagwati \r\nSecondary School came to our attention, as they are closely connected with the ground realities \r\nand are aware of the institutions that require aid.  \r\n● Lack of Educational Resources  \r\n● Awareness of Menstrual Hygiene  \r\n● Inclusive Approach to Education  \r\n● Limited Sports Infrastructure  \r\n● Inadequate Clean Water Facilities  \r\nIn summary, Shree Bhagwati Secondary School was selected due to its evident needs in \r\nvarious sectors like education, physical well -being and basic amenities. Project Paribhasa, through \r\nSEP, identified these gaps and tailored its activities to make a meanin gful and lasting impact on \r\nthe school\'s infrastructure and its students\' lives.  \r\n3 \r\n CHAPTER 2  \r\nACTIVITIES AND TASKS DONE DURING SEP  \r\n2.1 INTRODUCTION OF THE ACTIVITIES  \r\nThrough SEP, Project Paribhasa aimed to conduct various activities that were focused on \r\nthe students of different grades at Shree Bhagwati Secondary School. Book donation and library \r\nsetup, menstrual hygiene session along with pad donation to female student s and to the school, \r\ndonation of different types of sports materials to the school and lastly donation of a water tank and \r\na purifier were some of the major events we performed there.  \r\nACTIVITIES PERFORMED:  \r\n1. Book Donations and Library Setup  \r\nThrough this  program, we donated books that were helpful for students from grade 1 \r\nto grade 12 for their betterment. Along with the donation of books we also helped the school \r\nset up  the library as it really needed some change. We donated the books to the principal of the \r\nschool. The main objective of this program was to help every student get access to good books \r\nand to equal knowledge and provide a clean and friendly space to learn and study.  \r\n2. Menstrual Hygiene and Pad Donation  \r\nThe main objective behind this session was to provide knowledge regarding why \r\nwomen menstruate, what they should do, how to take care of themselves and other general \r\nfacts regarding menstruation. The participants in this session were the students of grade \r\n8,9,10,11 and 12.  \r\nWe started the session by discussing what menstruation is, why they happen, and then \r\nwe started discussing sanitary pads, how to wear them, how to dispose of them properly and 4 \r\n then the discussion went on regarding the myths and facts about menstruation. We also \r\ndiscussed the importance of nutrition, yoga while menstruating. In the session, male students \r\nwere also present and were openly discussing and sharing their experiences a nd teachers were \r\ninvolved and quite supportive during the session.  \r\nAt the end of the session, we distributed pads to every female student present there \r\nand then we donated the remaining pads to the school. And to the male participants of the \r\nsession, we gave them copies to appreciate their presence and their participation .  In total, we \r\ndonated 100 pads to the school so that the students could get access to clean and safe sanitary \r\npads in the school itself.  \r\n3. Donation of sports materials  \r\n             When we had a conversation with the school representative, we got to know that \r\nthe students did not have enough sports equipment to play in the school, thus we decided \r\nto donate various types of sports materials to the school. We donated chess  boards, ludo, \r\nfootball, volleyball, badminton rackets. The materials were handed over to the school’s \r\nvice principal. And after the donation, we asked the respective authority to allow the \r\nstudents to have a little play time where the students had a great  time playing different \r\ntypes of games. We played games like musical balls and we gave the winners some \r\ncopies and the rest were given to the school itself so that it could be provided to the needy \r\nstudents.  \r\n \r\n4. Donation of Water Tank and Purifier  \r\n           The major program of Project Paribhasa was the donation of a water tank and a \r\npurifier because we were told that the school does not have a proper tap allocated for 5 \r\n drinking water. And that it was one of the major requirements of the school. There was \r\nonly a pipe for drinking water and the students were not satisfied with it. Therefore, with \r\nthe motive of providing clean drinking water to the 215 students of Shree Bha gawati \r\nSecondary School, we donated a 1000 liter water tank and a water purifier to the school. \r\nThis really made a positive impact on the students and the school.  \r\n2.2 PROCEDURES OF THE TASKS PERFORMED  \r\nThe entire process required and done for the completion of Project Paribhasa’s programs \r\ncan be classified into the following important steps:  \r\n1. Selection of the school  \r\n              The very first step of SEP was to find a school where some help and assistance \r\nwas required. We were actually looking for a school where we could really make an impact \r\nand create a difference through our programs. Therefore, our search stoppe d when we got \r\nto know about Shree Bhagawati Secondary School located in Arbeni, Kaligandaki \r\nGaupalika -2, Gulmi.  \r\n2. Communication  \r\n            The next step after selecting the school was to set up objectives and goals that we \r\nhad to achieve. But before that, we also had to know about the necessities of the children \r\nat the school. Therefore, Project Paribhasa was in constant contact w ith the school Principal \r\nto know about the student\'s requirements and in what ways we could be helpful. Through \r\ncontinuous communication, we were able to know about the lack of sports materials, and \r\nlack of access to clean drinking water.  Because of commu nication, we were able to \r\ncomplete our project as well as address the student’s needs in an effective way. And it \r\nturned out to be really helpful for both parties  6 \r\n 3. Sponsorship  \r\n             After learning about the requirements at the school, we started to search for \r\nsponsors who were willing to help us complete our project and help the students in Gulmi. \r\nFor this, we started contacting the potential sponsors via email, calls, an d personal contacts. \r\nWe did not receive the anticipated responses yet we were supported by our three sponsors \r\nto whom we are really grateful. Garima Bikas Bank, Mahalaxmi Bikas Bank and Buddha \r\nPublication were our finalized sponsors who supported our proje ct and helped make \r\nimpacts in the lives of the 215 students of Shree Bhagwati Secondary School.  \r\n \r\nThe above mentioned were the major procedures for the completion of the tasks performed \r\nduring our SEP. After the materials were collected and bought, we headed towards our destination, \r\nand then we started to work as per mentioned in 2.1.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 7 \r\n CHAPTER 3  \r\nLEARNINGS, CHALLENGES, AND OUTCOMES  \r\n \r\n3.1 LEARNINGS  \r\nThe Social Experience Project has been one of the most fruitful projects of our educational \r\nlife where we got the opportunity to lively interact with people from rural areas, to know about \r\ntheir culture and traditions, their way of life and many more. There  are a lot of learnings that can \r\nbe listed but we would like to list the major ones which are elaborated under:  \r\na. Proper planning and organization  \r\nb. Team work  \r\nc. Sponsorships  \r\nd. Taking care of your belongings  \r\ne. Managerial skills  \r\nf. Compassion is really important  \r\ng. Gratefulness in what we have  \r\nWithin the duration of this project, the time spent at Shree Bhagwati Secondary School was \r\nbeyond any imagination and expectations. This project has taught us that planning is not important \r\nin just theories that we\'ve learned but in practical life too. To manage and organize a set of activities \r\nneed a proper planning and well scheduled timeline as we did from deciding in advance which \r\norganization should we choose to work on to companies to approach for sponsorships and \r\ndelegating tasks to each member. Rela ted to planning, the program has also given the opportunity \r\nto excel and practice our managerial skills. We interacted with the Red Cross Society members, 8 \r\n school principal, village head, teachers, staff and most  importantly the children there in the class. \r\nSimilarly, it gave us a platform to lead the topics we  delivered to the children.  \r\nBy far the most important lesson that we learned during the entire Social Experience  \r\nProject is ‘Teamwork’. We worked together from planning to execution and controlling the entire  \r\nset of activities we did. It taught us a valuable lesson that success cannot be achieved in isolation.  \r\nComparing the lives that we live here in Kathmandu valley as a student of KUSOM and  \r\nthe life they lived there as the locals of Gulmi were drastically different from each other which \r\ntaught us the importance of being grateful for what we have and to be compassionate with \r\neveryone. The bumpy roads, however beautiful the experience, subsiste nce food but tasty, poor \r\naccommodation but warm bonding among the Red Cross Society members were the unforgettable \r\nexperience we had. These experiences also come up with a bundle of learnings that are not just \r\napplicable in our professional life but play a n equal role in personal life and being a responsible \r\ncitizen of the country.  \r\n3.2 CHALLENGES  \r\nThere are challenges in every step of our lives and overcoming them and moving forward \r\nis what makes the journey precious and memorable. We also faced several challenges while \r\nexecuting the Social Experience Program which we have explained below:  \r\n1. Planning and Coordinating:  Although there were no issues with and among our team, \r\nthe only problem was that we were not able to sit together and start planning and \r\ncoordinating for the project because of our final examination of Semester 4. As this project \r\nwas something we had neve r done before, coming up with a perfect plan to execute this \r\nproject and make it successful was also very challenging.  \r\n 9 \r\n 2. Finding Sponsors:  The objective of our project was not only to provide literacy and  \r\nawareness sessions to the students, but it was also to help them with some stationery and  \r\nExtracurricular Activities (ECA)  items and books for the library at the school, which \r\nwould not be possible without the management of funds for which we had to find the \r\nsponsors. We also came across various challenges while communicating with sponsors and \r\nmanaging the required letters.  \r\n3. Coming up with the Content:  It was difficult for us to come up with appropriate content \r\nfor the awareness program part of our project due to the cultural differences. Menstrual \r\nhygiene awareness program, however, was a very successful program, more successful \r\nthan we had thought.  \r\n4. Managing Accommodation and Transportation:  One of the biggest challenges for us \r\nwas finding a suitable place for us to stay during the execution of the project. Since we \r\nwere not familiar with the place that we were visiting for the project, we didn’t have any \r\nidea about where we would be staying.  We also had a huge challenge of taking all the \r\ndonation items (stationery items, ECA items, books, sanitary pads, etc.) with us because \r\nthere were too many items along with our luggage and managing the vehicle was very \r\nimportant. In fact, the group had to  walk for about an hour and a half every day to go to the \r\nschool and return to the place of the accommodation.  \r\n5. Making Sessions Productive:  The main aim of our project was to give insightful and \r\nuseful sessions related to menstrual hygiene. But just delivering the contents of the sessions \r\nwould not be productive. We had to make sure that the students were actually \r\nunderstanding every content that we were delivering. However, the students turned out to \r\nbe very shy at first which made the initial part of the sessions less interactive.  10 \r\n  \r\n6. Accommodation and Food:  The traditional home that we stayed in lacked modern \r\ncomforts, basic sanitation, and easy access to clean drinking water. The food variety was \r\nalso restricted to local produce, and the absence of cooking facilities created logistical \r\nissues.  \r\n \r\nDespite all these challenges present while conducting our SEP, we thoroughly  \r\nenjoyed every bit of it while working together as a team and finding out ways to resolve and  \r\novercome them.  \r\n3.3 OUTCOMES  \r\nSome of the outcomes from this project are listed as follows;  \r\n- Students, even the boys, got an in -depth overview of menstrual hygiene.  \r\n- Library setup to make sure that the students will not have to limit their knowledge.  \r\n- Setting up Extra Curricular time, for students to engage in activities beyond studies.  \r\n- Increased motivation of students to come to the schools, due to the availability of the  \r\nsports items, donated by Team Paribhasa leading to lesser number of absentees.  \r\n- Begining of discussion on sensitive topics like safe menstrual hygiene.  \r\n- Facilitating students of the rural part of Nepal to participate in events which were being \r\nheld in urban schools of Kathmandu Valley.  \r\n- Furthering the relationship between KUSOM and different business houses through  \r\nsuccessful sponsorship collaborations.  \r\n 11 \r\n CONCLUSION  \r\n                Project Paribhasa would not have been able to help the school and its students if not for \r\nthe sponsors who assisted and supported us and made it so much easier for us. We would like to \r\nextend a hearty thanks and appreciation  to our sponsors : Garima Bikas Bank, Mahalaxmi Bikas \r\nBank and Buddha Publications. With your generous support we were able to complete our project \r\nsuccessfully and bring smiles to the faces of 215 students of Shree Bhagwati Secondary School. It \r\nwould have been almost impo ssible to complete SEP without their assistance. Thus, we are very \r\nmuch grateful towards our generous sponsors.  \r\n                Along with our sponsors we also want to extend our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to \r\nthe school and to the school administration who were kind enough to help us and cooperate with \r\nus which made our tasks so much easier. Without their sup port, we would not have been able to \r\nfulfill the student\'s needs and be as impactful as we were able to with their full support. We are \r\nalso grateful to the school for making us feel so welcomed and comfortable. We will never forget \r\ntheir kindness and warm  gestures towards us.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 12 \r\n \r\nAppendix  \r\n \r\n \r\n 13 \r\n \r\n14 \r\n \r\n15 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n16 \r\n \r\n17 \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n18 \r\n  \r\n', 'The Social Experience Project, led by Bachelor of Business Administration students,  sought to uplift Shree Bhagwati Secondary School in Gulmi, Nepal.

Ad Prediction using Click Through Rate and Machine Learning with Reinforcement\r\n\r\nThis conference paper focuses on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, represents a significant stride in the domain of online advertising optimization. The paper begins by addressing the steps of dataset collection, utilizing the Ads_CTR_Optimizsation dataset from Kaggle, consisting of information on 10 advertisements and 10,000 user clicks. The dataset choice, while providing a foundation for experimentation, raises concerns about the generalizability of findings to diverse advertising scenarios. The exploration of the dataset reveals a binary nature (0 and 1) representing user clicks on advertisements, forming the basics for the reinforcement learning models. Introduction of reinforcement learning as a field within machine learning sets the stage for the subsequent application of UCB and Thomspon Sampling. Reinforcement learning, with its focus on maximizing rewards, is appropriately framed within the context of online advertising, where the algorithm learns from its experiences rather than relying on predefined answers. The methodology section elaborates the use of UCB algorithm and the Thompson Samling algorithm. UCB algorithm involves calculating average rewards and confidence intervals for each advertisement, while Thompson Sampling relies on randomly generated beliefs to select ads. The subsequent application of these algorithms to the dataset yields insightful results. The experimentation phase, spanning 1000 rounds, highlights the efficiency of the algorithms. Random Selection surprisingly identifies Ad-9 as the best-performing ad among the 10 ads, laying the foundation for comparison with the more sophisticated UCB and Thompson Samling algorithms. UCB, when applied for different rounds, exhibits varying performances, with Ad-5 and Ad-8 emerging as top-performing ads in different scenarios. Thompson Sampling consistently prioritizes Ad-5 across all rounds, outperforming UCB in predictive accuracy. Potential challenges related to algorithm sensitivity, assumption of stationarity in user behavior, and the impact of feature representation are some of the limitations which could be a topic of discussion. Despite these constraints, it provides valuable insights into the practical application of reinforcement learning for ad prediction, with Thomspon Sampling consistently demonstrating superior performance, exploring alternative machine learning approaches for insights into online advertising optimization (Lakshmanarao, et al., 2021). \r\n\r\n2. Ad Click Prediction in Sequence with Long Short-Term Memory Networks: An Eternality-aware Model\r\n\r\nThis paper explains the significant evolution of online advertising, with ad click prediction addressing the critical task of the ad click prediction in sponsored search systems. It addresses the problem related to click-though rate (CTR) in sponsored ads, where the accuracy of the click prediction significantly impacts the user search experience and business revenue. The proposed approach/ methodology utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells for sequential click prediction. The LSTM-RNN architecture is detailed, involving the sequential feeding of ads from ML1 to ML4, where ML1 is the first ad displayed in mainline, considering the information from previous ads. Authors have conducted analysis of externalities, demonstrating the impact of the CTR of the first ad (ML1) on the CTR of the second ad (ML2). The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using standard metrics such as Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) and Relative Information Gain (RIG), showcasing the improvements over a baseline Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Acknowledging certain limitations and challenges, the primary concern covered is the high computational cost associated with the LSTM-RNN model, which may hinder its real-time applicability in dynamic advertising environments. To address this, a simplified version is proposed, reducing computation costs while maintaining a substantial portion of the accuracy gains. The analysis of externalities reveals that the quality of the first ad impacts the CTR of subsequent ads, establishing the influence of ad quality on sequential CTR. The LSTM-RNN model outperforms the baseline DNN model, demonstrating improvements in AUC and RIG across various ad positions. To address computation cost, a simplified version with a new externality feature is proposed, achieving significant gains with reduced complexity. Statistical significance tests support the meaningfulness of the observed performance differences (Deng, et al., 2018).\r\n\r\n3. Deep User Segment Interest Network Modeling for Click-Through Rate Prediction of Online Advertising \r\n\r\nUse of a novel Deep User Segment Interest Network (DUSIN) model for predicting click-through rates (CTR) in online advertising is introduced. The model architecture comprises key layers, including an Embedding Layer transforming user behavior sequences, an Individual Interest Extractor Layer utilizing a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for extracting individual user interests, a Segment Interest Activating Layer updating segment interests based on the last hidden vector, and a Segment Interest Activating Layer inspired by Deep Interest Network (DIN). Employing the Tobacco dataset, researchers undertake preprocessing steps like under sampling for class imbalance and defines user segments based on features related to age and gender. Baseline algorithms such as MLP, PNN, DeepFM and DIN are compared using evaluation metrics like AUC and log loss. Insights from segment interest are gained by visualizing differences using Euclidean distances, providing valuable perspectives on user preferences within the predefined segments. The model performance comparison demonstrates the superiority of DUSIN, with notable AUC gains over baseline models. Specifically, DUSIN achieved an AUC gain of 0.0017 over MLP and a further gain of 0.0029 with a sequence length of 100. The analysis of different behavior sequence lengths emphasizes the significance of historical user behavior, indicating optimal performance with longer sequence for DUSIN. Concluding with a focus on the importance of segment interests and the effectiveness of DUSIN, authors are suggesting future research directions involving automatic segmentation methods and ensemble approaches. The findings offer valuable insights into user segment dynamics, emphasizing the practical relevance of DUSIN in real-time advertising systems. The ability of model to outperform baseline algorithms underscores its potential for enhancing CTR prediction accuracy. The consideration of different behavior sequence lengths provides nuanced perspectives on the temporal aspects of user behavior. While the research proposed provides valuable contributions, it also acknowledges certain limitations, including the reliance on predefined user segments and the potential of dataset high dimensional spare features. Addressing these limitations could further enhance applicability of model across diverse online advertising contexts (Kim, et al., 2021).\r\n\r\n4. Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the integration of machine learning algorithms in customer segmentations has become pivotal for businesses aiming to enhance customer satisfaction, retention, and overall profitability. The methodologies and models employed, provides insights into the evolving era of customer relationship management (CRM) and its intersection with cutting-edge clustering algorithms. The research focused on customer segmentation introduces diverse methodologies of clustering models, including the widely utilized K-means algorithm known for its computational efficiency, the hierarchical clustering approach that builds a hierarchy of data points, the density-based clustering represented by DBSCAN, and the Affinity Propagation Algorithm, which stands out for its ability to identify clusters without a predefined number. The methodology underscores the significance of CRM in modern marketing, emphasizing its role in customer value analysis and the development of persistent customer-company relationships. Customer segmentation emerges as a crucial aspect, involving the division of the market into distinct buyer groups based on behaviors and characteristics. The use of clustering algorithms becomes evident as a powerful tool in predicting consumption trends and refining marketing strategies. The comparative analysis of these clustering algorithms reveals valuable insights into their performance across dimensions such as computation speed, adaptability to dataset characteristics, and overall efficiency. K-Means, for instance, exhibits high computational efficiency. K-Means, exhibits high computational efficiency bur grapples with the challenge of dependency on the initial number of clusters. Hierarchical clustering, although versatile in cluster formation, faces limitations in computational speed, making it more suitable for smaller datasets. The finding shows the importance of choosing the appropriate clustering algorithm based on specific dataset characteristics and analytical goals. Moreover, it acknowledges the limitations associated with interpreting cluster meanings and suggests a potential enhancement by addressing these challenges. However, the review suggests a need for real-world case studies to illustrate the practical application of clustering algorithms in diverse business scenarios, bridging the gap between theoretical insights and practical implications (Patel, et al., 2020).\r\n\r\n5. Analysis of Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for an Efficient Customer Segmentation using Clustering Ensemble and Spectral Clustering\r\n\r\nThe article presents an insightful analysis of unsupervised machine learning techniques for efficient customer segmentation using a novel clustering ensemble and spectral clustering approach. The models employed include DBSCAN, K-Means, Mini Batch K-Means, Mean Shift, and Spectral Clustering. Data is collected from Moroccan residents through a questionnaire, resulting in a dataset of 1357 individuals with eight distinguishing traits. The methodology involves applying individual clustering models to the dataset and combining their results using clustering ensemble and spectral clustering. The proposed model is then applied to a real dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in clustering diverse populations. Performance evaluation using metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Silhouette Coefficient (SC), and Davies-Bouldin Index (DI), demonstrating the superiority of model over traditional clustering approaches is performed. The findings showcase the distinct clusters based on demographics and socioeconomic attributes. Cluster 3 comprises educated, high income, non-single females in large cities, while Cluster 4 consists of single men with higher incomes in urban centers. Median age comparisons highlight variations across clusters, with Cluster 2 and 3 showing younger ages (28.5 and 29), and Clusters 1 and 4 exhibiting notably older ages (36 and 37). Application to a real dataset identifies five clusters, with Cluster 0 representing middle class single men and Cluster 4 comprising married women with high income and education. The proposed model outperforms traditional models in performance metrics, with ARI, NMI, SC, and DI values of 0.7014, 0.7175, 0.7289, and 0.7515, respectively, indicating its efficacy in capturing complex patterns within datasets. However, the study has limitations. It primarily relies on traditional clustering models, and the exploration of advanced techniques like deep learning could enhance clustering capabilities. Generalizing may be limited to the specific characteristics of the Moroccan residents surveyed, necessitating validation across diverse datasets and populations. Lastly, the explicit discussions on potential biases in data collection and ethical considerations lacks, raising concerns about the fairness of clustering outcomes (Karim & Hicham, 2022). \r\n\r\n6. K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering Methods for Customer Segmentation in Online Retail Datasets\r\n\r\nIn this study conducted in 2022, the authors focuses on the application of K-Means and K-Medoids clustering methods for customer segmentation in online retail datasets. The research employed a methodology encompassing various stages. Data collection involved the utilization of online retail customer data obtained from Kaggle, comprising parameters such as invoice, stock code, description, invoice data, price, customer ID, and country. The subsequent data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, conducting regency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis, addressing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR), and normalizing the data. The clustering methods applied were K-Means and K-Medoids, each requiring the determination of the optimal number of cluster (K). The elbow method was employed for this purpose. For K-Means, the study identified the optimal K value as 4, resulting in four distinct clusters with specific characteristics related to customer behavior. K-Medoids, with an optimal K value of 6, formed six clusters, offering a more detailed segmentation based on RFM analysis. The results analysis involved an examination and interpretation of the characteristics of each cluster obtained from both clustering methods. Making the importance of preprocessing steps and highlighting the implications for businesses in tailoring their strategies based on the identified customer clusters, findings are explained properly. The generalization of the findings maybe be constrained due to the specific characteristics of the dataset and focus on clustering techniques neglects the exploration of other potential factors influencing customer behavior. The reliance on the elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters may not be universally applicable, and analysis with alternative clustering algorithms is absent. The implication of study has become evident that the identified clusters provide valuable insights for businesses in enhancing their marketing and operational strategies. The research contributes to the understanding of customer behavior in online retail, emphasizing the need for addressing outliers and providing actionable insights for businesses seeking to optimize their online retail strategies (Mufarroha, et al., 2022).\r\n\r\n7. AdRobot: A Smart Segmentation Application for Automated & Personalized Marketing Campaigns\r\n\r\nThis paper addresses a critical challenge in contemporary marketing connecting the right promotional campaign with the right audience in the digital area. The authors present AdRobot as a solution, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to automate and personalize the marketing strategies. The proposed algorithm investigates profiling and conversational data, employing AI heuristics to adeptly match audiences with tailored promotional campaigns. The methodology comprises two key data collection approaches. Firstly, conversational constraints are automatically gathered from interactions with the Chatfuel chatbot, encompassing details such as age, field of work, martial status, and interests. Secondly, customer responses to marketing agent posts on social media platforms, including likes, dislikes, ratings, and comments, are collected. Distance correlation, Levenshtein distance, and Euclidean distance to match customers with the most suitable promotional campaigns based on characteristics like departure place, arrival place, departure date, ticket type and price are utilization for the research. The integration of Chatfuel chatbot and DialogFlow is pivotal to the process. Chatfuel facilitates user interactions, while DialogFlow contributes to natural language understanding, aiding in the determination of customer intents during conversations. The overall process involves the initiation of conversation, data collection through forms or predefined questions, and the generation of targets for customized advertising campaigns. The results showcase the effectiveness of the algorithm, with a positive user response indicating a 70% satisfaction rate regarding the accuracy of matched offers. However, the paper acknowledges certain limitations. Notably, the reliance on data exclusively from Facebook interactions raises concerns about the generalization of findings across diverse social media platforms. The researchers have primarily focused on a specific industry potentially limiting its applicability to other domains. This innovation emerges as a solution for automated and personalized marketing campaigns, leveraging AI and advanced algorithms to enhance audience targeting. The finding suggests the potential of automated marketing strategies, in personalized and targeted advertising (Hafaiedh, et al., 2020).\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nDeng, W. et al., 2018.

Ad Prediction using Click Through Rate and Machine Learning \r\nwith Reinforcement  \r\nThis conference paper  focuses on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson \r\nSampling, represents a significant stride in the domain of online advertising optimization. \r\nThe paper begins by addressing the steps of dataset collection, utilizing the \r\nAds_CTR_Optimizsation dataset from Kaggle, consisting of information on 10 \r\nadvertisements and 10,000 user clicks. This dataset choice, while providing a foundation \r\nfor experiment ation, raises concerns about the generalizability of findings to diverse \r\nadvertising scenarios.  The exploration of the dataset reveals a binary nature (0 and 1) \r\nrepresenting user clicks on advertisements, forming the basics for the reinforcement \r\nlearning models. The introduction of reinforcement learning as a field within machine \r\nlearning sets the st age for the subsequent application of UCB and Thomspon Sampling. \r\nReinforcement learning, with its focus on maximizing rewards, is appropriately framed \r\nwithin the context of online  advertising, where the algorithm learns from its experiences \r\nrather than rel ying on predefined answers. The paper explains the methodology by \r\ndetailing the UCB algorithm and the Thompson Sampling algorithm. The UCB algorithm \r\ninvolves calculating average rewards and confidence intervals for each advertisement, \r\nwhile Thompson Sampling relies on randomly genera ted beliefs to select ads. The \r\nsubsequent application of these algorithms to the dataset yields insightful results . The \r\nexperimentation phase, spanning 1000 rounds, highlights the efficiency of the algorithms. \r\nRandom Selection surprisingly identifies Ad -9 as the best -performing ad  among the 10 \r\nads, laying the foundation for comparison with the more sophisticated UCB and \r\nThompson Samling algorithms. UCB, when applied for different rounds, exhibits varying \r\nperformances, with Ad -5 and Ad -8 emerging as top -performing ads in different scenarios. \r\nThompson Sampling consistently prioritizes Ad -5 across all rounds, outperforming UCB \r\nin pre dictive accuracy.  The paper acknowledges its limitations, emphasizing the origin of \r\ndataset and potential challenges related to algorithm sensitivity, assumption of stationarity \r\nin user behavior, and the impact of feature representation. Despite these constraints, the \r\nstudy provides valuable insights into the practical application of reinforcement learning \r\nfor ad prediction, with Thomspon Sampling consistently demonstrating superior \r\nperformance. The literature review also explores alternative  machine learning  6CS014  \r\n2 \r\n approaches for comprehensive insights into online advertising optimization  \r\n(Lakshmanarao, et al., 2021) .  \r\n1. Ad Click Prediction in Sequence with Long Short -Term Memory \r\nNetworks: An Eternality -aware Model  \r\nThis paper explains the significant evolution of online advertising, with ad click prediction  \r\naddressing the critical task of the ad click prediction in sponsored search systems. The \r\npaper covers the problem related to click -though rate (CTR) in sponsored ads, where the \r\naccuracy of the click prediction significantly impacts the user search experie nce and \r\nbusiness revenue.  The proposed approach utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) \r\nwith Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) cells for sequential click prediction. The LSTM -\r\nRNN architecture is detailed, involving the sequential feeding of ads from ML1 to ML4,  \r\nwhere ML1 is the first  ad displayed in mainline, considering the information from previous \r\nads. The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of externalities, demonstrating the \r\nimpact of the CTR of the first ad (ML1) on the CTR of the second ad (ML2). The \r\nperformance of the propo sed model is evaluated using standard metrics such as Area \r\nunder Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) and Relative Information Gain \r\n(RIG), showcasing the improvements over a baseline Deep Neural Network (DNN) model.  \r\nThe paper acknowledges certain limitations and challenges. The primary concern is the \r\nhigh computational cost associated with the LSTM -RNN model, which may hinder its real -\r\ntime applicability in dynamic advertising environments. To address this, a simplifie d \r\nversion is proposed, reducing computation costs while maintaining a substantial portion \r\nof the accuracy gains. The paper explores ad click prediction in sequential contexts. The \r\nanalysis of externalities reveals that the quality of the first ad impacts the CTR of \r\nsubsequent ads, establishing the influence of ad quality on sequential CTR. The LSTM -\r\nRNN model outperfo rms the baseline DNN model, demonstrating improvements in AUC \r\nand RIG across various ad positions. To address computation cost, a simplified version \r\nwith a new externality feature is proposed, achieving significant gains with reduced \r\ncomplexity. Statistica l significance tests support the meaningfulness of the observed \r\nperformance differences. Overall, the paper contributes a valuable approach to sequential \r\nad-click prediction  (Deng, et al., 2018) .  6CS014  \r\n3 \r\n 2. Deep User Segment Interest Network Modeling for Click -Through \r\nRate Prediction of Online Advertising  \r\nThe study introduces a novel Deep User Segment Interest Network (DUSIN) for predicting \r\nclick-though rates (CTR) in online advertising. The model architecture comprises key \r\nlayers, including an Embedding Layer transforming user behavior sequences, an \r\nIndivi dual Interest Extractor Layer utilizing a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for extracting \r\nindividual user interests, a Segment Interest Activating Layer updating segment interests \r\nbased on the last hidden vector, and a Segment Interest Activating Layer inspired by Deep \r\nInterest Network (DIN). The study employs the Tobacco dataset, undertakes \r\npreprocessing steps like under sampling for class imbalance, and defines user segments \r\nbased on features related to age and gender.  Baseline algorithms such as MLP, PNN, \r\nDeepFM and DIN are compared using evaluation metrics like AUC and log loss.  \r\nInsights from segment interest are gained by visualizing differences using Euclidean \r\ndistances, providing valuable perspectives on user preferences within the predefined \r\nsegments. The model performance comparison demonstrates the superiority of DUSIN, \r\nwith notable AUC gains over baseline models. Specifically, DUSIN achieved an AUC gain  \r\nof 0.0017 over MLP and a further gain of 0.0029 with a sequence length of 100. The \r\nanalysis of different behavior sequence lengths emphasizes the significance of historical \r\nuser behavior, indicating optimal performance with longer sequence for DUSIN. The study \r\nconcludes by emphasizing the importance of segment interests and the effec tiveness of \r\nDUSIN, suggesting future research directions involving automatic segmentation methods \r\nand ensemble approaches.  The findings offer valuable insights into user segment \r\ndynamics, emphasizing the practical relevance of DUSIN in real -time advertising \r\nsystems. The ability of model to outperform baseline algorithms underscores its potential \r\nfor enhancing CTR prediction ac curacy. The consideration of different behavior sequence \r\nlengths provides nuanced perspectives on the temporal aspects of user behavior. While \r\nthe study provides valuable contributions, it also acknowledges certain limitations, \r\nincluding the reliance on pr edefined user segments and the potential of dataset high \r\ndimensional spare features. Addressing these limitations could further enhance \r\napplicability of model across diverse online advertising contexts  (Kim, et al., 2021) .  6CS014  \r\n4 \r\n 3. Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning  \r\nIn recent years, the integration of machine learning algorithms in customer segmentations \r\nhas become pivotal for businesses aiming to enhance customer satisfaction, retention, \r\nand overall profitability. This paper explores the methodologies and models empl oyed, \r\nproviding insights into the evolving landscape of customer relationship management \r\n(CRM) and its intersection with cutting -edge clustering algorithms. The paper introduces \r\ndiverse methodologies of clustering models, including the widely utilized K -means \r\nalgorithm known for its computational efficiency, the hierarchical clustering approach that \r\nbuilds a hierarchy of data points, the density -based clusteri ng represented by DBSCAN, \r\nand the Affinity Propagation Algorithm, which stands out for its ability to identify clusters \r\nwithout a predefined number.  The methodology section underscores the significance of \r\nCRM in modern marketing, emphasizing its role in customer value analysis and the \r\ndevelopment of enduring customer -company relationships. Customer segmentation \r\nemerges as a crucial aspect, involving th e division of the market into distinct buyer groups \r\nbased on behaviors and characteristics. The use of clustering algorithms becomes \r\nevident as a powerful tool in predicting consumption trends and refining marketing \r\nstrategies. The comparative analysis of these clustering algorithms reveals valuable \r\ninsights into their performance across dimensions such as computation speed, \r\nadaptability to dataset characteristics, and overall efficiency. K -Means, for instance, \r\nexhibits high computational efficiency. K -Means, exhibits high computational efficiency \r\nbur grapples with the challenge of dependency on the initial number of clusters. \r\nHierarchical clustering, although versatile in cluster formation, faces limit ations in \r\ncomputational speed, making it more suitable for smaller datasets.  \r\nThe finding shows the importance of choosing the appropriate clustering algorithm based \r\non specific dataset characteristics and analytical goals. Moreover, it acknowledges the \r\nlimitations associated with interpreting cluster meanings and suggests a potenti al \r\nenhancement by addressing these challenges. However, the review suggests a need for \r\nreal-world case studies to illustrate the practical application of clustering algorithms in \r\ndiverse business scenarios, bridging the gap between theoretical insights and  practical \r\nimplications (Patel, et al., 2020) .  6CS014  \r\n5 \r\n  \r\n4. Analysis of Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for an \r\nEfficient Customer Segmentation using Clustering Ensemble and \r\nSpectral Clustering  \r\nThe article presents an insightful analysis of unsupervised machine learning techniques \r\nfor efficient customer segmentation using a novel clustering ensemble and spectral \r\nclustering approach. The models employed include DBSCAN, K -Means, Mini Batch K -\r\nMeans,  Mean Shift, and Spectral Clustering. Data is collected from Moroccan residents \r\nthrough a questionnaire, resulting in a dataset of 1357 individuals with eight distinguishing  \r\ntraits. The methodology involves applying individual clustering models to the data set and \r\ncombining their results using clustering ensemble and spectral clustering. The proposed \r\nmodel is then applied to a real dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in clustering diverse \r\npopulations. The study evaluates performance using metrics such as A djusted Rand \r\nIndex (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Silhouette Coefficient (SC), and \r\nDavies -Bouldin Index (DI), demonstrating the superiority of model over traditional \r\nclustering models.  The findings reveal distinct clusters based on demographics and \r\nsocioeconomic attributes. Cluster 3 comprises educated, high income, non -single \r\nfemales in large cities, while Cluster 4 consists of single men with higher incomes in urban \r\ncenters. Median age  comparisons highlight variations across clusters, with Cluster 2 and \r\n3 showing younger ages (28.5 and 29), and Clusters 1 and 4 exhibiting notably older ages \r\n(36 and 37). Application to a real da taset identifies five clusters, with Cluster 0 \r\nrepresenting middle class single men and Cluster 4 comprising married women with high \r\nincome and education. The proposed model outperforms traditional models in \r\nperformance metrics, with ARI, NMI, SC, and DI values of 0.7014, 0.7175, 0.7289, and \r\n0.7515, respectively, i ndicating its efficacy in capturing complex patterns within datasets.  \r\nHowever, the study has limitations. It primarily relies on traditional clustering models, and \r\nthe exploration of advanced techniques like deep learning could enhance clustering \r\ncapabilities. Generalizing may be limited to the specific characteristics of th e Moroccan \r\nresidents surveyed, necessitating validation across diverse datasets and populations. \r\nThe article lacks explicit discussions on potential biases in data collection and ethical  6CS014  \r\n6 \r\n considerations, raising concerns about the fairness of clustering outcomes  (Karim & \r\nHicham, 2022) .  \r\n5. K-Means and K -Medoids Clustering Methods for Customer \r\nSegmentation in Online Retail Datasets  \r\nIn this study conducted in 2022, the authors focused on the application of K -Means and \r\nK-Medoids clustering methods for customer segmentation in online retail datasets. The \r\nresearch employed a methodology encompassing various stages. Data collection \r\ninvolv ed the utilization of online retail customer data obtained from Kaggle, comprising \r\nparameters such as invoice, stock code, description, invoice data, price, customer ID, and \r\ncountry. The subsequent data preprocessing steps included handling missing values,  \r\nconducting regency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis, addressing outliers using \r\nthe Interquartile Range (IQR), and normalizing the data. The clustering methods applied \r\nwere K -Means and K -Medoids, each requiring the determination of the optimal number \r\nof cluster (K). The elbow method was employed for this purpose. For K -Means, the study \r\nidentified the optimal K value as 4, resulting in four distinct clusters with specific \r\ncharacteristics related to customer behavior. K -Medoids, with an optimal K value of 6, \r\nformed six clusters, offering a more detailed segmentation based on RFM analysis . The \r\nresults analysis involved an examination and interpretation of the characteristics of each \r\ncluster obtained from both clustering methods. The study concluded by explaining the \r\nfindings, making the importance of preprocessing steps, and highlighting the  implications \r\nfor businesses in tailoring their strategies based on the identified customer clusters. The \r\ngeneralization of the findings maybe be constrained due to the specific characteristics of \r\nthe dataset and  focus on clustering techniques neglects the  exploration of other potential \r\nfactors influencing customer behavior. The reliance on the elbow method for determining \r\nthe optimal number of clusters may not be universally applicable, and analysis with \r\nalternative clustering algorithms is absent.  The implication of study has become evident \r\nthat the identified clusters provide valuable insights for businesses in enhancing their \r\nmarketing and operational strategies. The research contributes to the understanding of \r\ncustomer behavior in online retail, emphasizing the need for addressing outliers and  6CS014  \r\n7 \r\n providing actionable insights for businesses seeking to optimize their online retail \r\nstrategies  (Mufarroha, et al., 2022) . \r\n6.

Problem Statement  \nDue to the expansion in digital information, a challenge of information overloading has \nbeen seen . Dealing with lengthy documents and research materials becomes time \nconsuming, hindering the ability to extract crucial information quickly.  A study \npublished in Nature Communication reveals that our collective attention span is \nnarrowing. This is not just on social media but also in different domains , that people \nare losing their attention span  (Lorenz -Spreen, et al., 2019) . Due to the low attention \nspan, most individuals are not likely to read journals, books, and other documented \nfiles. The rise of audio -visual content has also impacted the consumption of text -based \ninformation. These days the way of consuming information ha s changed which is a 6CS007  \n5 \n positive thing but in context of a person with academic background in performing \nresearch based on text -based documents,  one of the pain -points I have been facing  \nis analyzing and curating the contents from lengthy documents . In the professional  \nworld, handling and extracting major key points  from proposals  and documents could \nbe a terrible task for working individuals until there is a summarization tool that makes \nthe task easier.  \n1.5.4.  Project as Solution  \nProfessionals, researchers, and students face challenges of extracting content from \nresearch papers and journals. This summarization tool will extract important insights \nfrom a paper to make informed decisions quickly.  Dealing with lengthy documents that \nrequire significant time and effort is a terrible task, the project will be able to minimize \nthe time required and will prioritize important documents. This  tool will help streamline \nthe process of summarizing and aggregating information from multiple sourc es and \nwill store it for further usage of the user.  People will be able to access necessary \ncontent  in a short format,  saving time.  It will encourage continuous learning by allowing \nusers to explore a broader range of topics within a shorter time frame.  \n2. Initial Research  \n2.1. Hugging Face  \nHugging Face is a platform for data science and machine learning which was initially \ndeveloped in 2017 as a chatbot app for teenagers but has expanded its domain from \njust a chatbot app. This platform has a range of functionalities from creating, hosting, \nand managing their own AI models to engaging in discussions and collaborations \nwithin the platform. Hugging face also holds a substantial collection of models and \ndatasets created by the collaborators and users. This platform encompasses a range \nof AI appl ications like computer vision, audio analysis, and natural language \nprocessing (Rebelo, 2023) . \n2.2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  \nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a division of AI that aims to make computers \ncomprehend, analyze, and produce human language. NLP plays and significant role \nin extracting the most meaningful information. NLP encompasses various techniques \nand methods to process and understand human language. The division of NLP 6CS007  \n6 \n approaches extractive and abstractive summarization, along with other categories \nsuch as single -document, multi -document, and query -based summarization.  \n2.2.1.  Abstractive Summarization  \nAbstractive summarization is a method where the generated summary doesn’t \nnecessarily consist of sentences present in the original text, instead it creates new \nsentences that capture the key concepts. This is a approach where the new texts are \ngenerated on ly after abstracting and understanding the semantic meaning of the text \nwhile capturing the key concepts of the original content.  \n2.2.2.  Extractive Summarization  \nSimilarly, Extractive summarization involves choosing sentences directly from the \nsource text to create a concise summarization. Then the chosen text based content is \ntypically chosen based on its importance and relevance. This method aims to retain \nthe or iginal wording from the text, making it more conservative approach to \nsummarization (Adhikari, et al., 2020) .  \n3. Literature Review  \n3.1. NLP Based Text Summarization Using Semantic Analysis  \n3.1.1.  Introduction  \nText Summarization is a supervised learning method, that heavily relies on Natural \nLanguage Processing (NLP), which helps in generating concise and comprehensive \nsummaries from massive number of text -based inputs.  \nThis literature review focuses on the research paper titled “NLP Based Text \nSummarization Using Sematic Analysis” which introduces an innovative approach for \nspecific text summarization. To save manual effort in information processing, the study \ndiscusses the challenges of summarizing large texts and highlights the use of \nautomatic summarization tools. The author offers a method based on Semantic \nAnalysis, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps in extracting \nrepresentative sentences and generates meaningful summaries.  \n 6CS007  \n7 \n 3.1.2.  Methodology  \nThe proposed methodology in this research paper leverages a technique based on \nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for text summarization. LSA is used to extract \nsemantically important sentences and generate a summary of the input text. First, the \ninput documen t undergoes data preprocessing method, where irrelevant words such \nas stop, words are removed to enhance the quality of the summary. A matrix of word \ncounts is constructed from preprocessed text, representing the occurrence of words \nacross sentences. The s entence matrix undergoes Singular Value Decomposition \n(SVD) to reduce dimensionality and identify the latent semantic structure of the text. \nThis helps in identifying the most noticeable feature of the document, enabling \nextraction of meaningful sentences for summary. Based on latent semantic structure, \nthe system identifies the most relevant sentence and arranges them in a coherent \nmanner to generate the final summary.  \n \nFigure 2  Proposed System (Moiyadi, et al., 2016)  \nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used for \nidentifying the most important sentences in a text document. Below is the \nmathematical equation for the LSA method.  \nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD)  \nSVD is used to factorize the term -document matrix into three matrices: u, ∑, and v  \nu, s, v = svds (matrix, k= num_concepts)  \n6CS007  \n8 \n Saliency Vector Calculation  \nThe saliency of each sentence is calculated as the dot product of the squared values \nin u and v.  \nsaliency_vec = np.dot (np.square(u), np.square(v))  \nTopic Filtering  \nSingular values below a certain threshold controlled by topic_sigma_threshold are set \nto zero to filter out less significant topics.  \nu [u < sigma_threshold] = 0  \nTop Sentence Selection  \nThe top sentences are selected based on their saliency scores.  \ntop_sentences = saliency_vec.argsort() [ -length:] [:: -1] \nHere, the code implements Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to perform text \nsummarization. First the input text is preprocessed, and a term -document matrix is \ngenerated. Then SVD is applied to identify the important topics and sentences and at \nlast the salien t sentences are selected to create a summary.  \n3.1.3.  Discussion  \nThe authors applied LSA -based summarization technique to a diverse set of texts and \nevaluated the performance of generated summaries. They measured the quality of the \nsummaries using various metrics, including ROUGE scores, F1 -score, and precision -\nrecall c urves. The study indicates that LSA approach performed better than existing \nsummarization techniques (Moiyadi, et al., 2016) .  \n \n \n \n \n \n 6CS007  \n9 \n 3.2. Survey on NLP based automatic extractive text  \nsummarization using Spacy  \n3.2.1.  Introduction  \nThis article provides a general overview of the area of NLP -based automated text \nsummarization. It seeks to discuss and evaluate frequently used summarizing \ntechniques by the researchers with an emphasis on useful and successful tactics with \nan insight int o the evolution of summarization. The major key points that the article \ndiscusses are the difficulties of numerically evaluating the quality of summary and the \ndistinctions between extractive and abstractive summarization.  \nThe article offers a comprehensive examination of text summarization, tracing its \nevolution from early IBM research in 1950s to modern methods. The authors delve \ninto the fundamental ideas behind extractive summarizing techniques, putting special \nemphasis on the importance of elements like key phrase recognition and sentence \npositioning during the summarization procedure. These methods are considered as \nthe pillars that support the development of contemporary extractive summarization \napproaches.  \n3.2.2.  NLP and Ambiguity  \nText summarization and other applications, such as language translation and \nchatbots, rely heavily on NLP, which emphasizes its importance in comprehending \nand interpreting human language. NLP is complicated because natural language is \noften unclear and un certain. There are different types of uncertainties in language: \nLexical ambiguity; that occurs when a single word has multiple meanings. Syntactic \nambiguity: this occurs from the way words are structured in sentences. For instance, \nthe phrase “Visiting re latives can be tedious” can have two different interpretations. \nLastly, semantic ambiguity: this occurs when the meaning of words themselves are \nunclear.  \n \n3.2.3.  Phases of Natural Language Processing  \nThe article claims that the phases of NLP including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, \nsemantic analysis, discourse integration and pragmatic analysis help in analyzing \nambiguities. Lexical analysis is the first step where the sentences are divided into  6CS007  \n10 \n tokens. For the second step, syntactic analysis or parsing is performed, where the \nword order is studied then in semantic analysis meaning and word order is analyzed. \nAfter performing discourse integration, pragmatic analysis is performed which is the \nlast stage, where real impact of text is gained.  \n \n \nFigure 3 Phases of Natural Language Processing (Prakash, et al., 2022) . \n3.2.4.  Preprocessing  \nTo retrieve valid information, pre -processing steps in text summarization are depicted \nin the article including sentence separation, stop words removal, stemming, part -of \nspeech tagging and keyword extraction.  \n3.2.5.  Conclusion  \nThe authors make recommendations for potential future text summarizing research. \nThey draw attention to the fact that it can be difficult to reach consensus between \nmultiple annotators and that we need more effective tools to automatically verify text \nsumm aries. This demonstrates how the industry is developing and working towards \nmore effective automatic text summarization systems (Prakash, et al., 2022) . \n \n \n \n6CS007  \n11 \n 3.3. Implementation of NLP based on automatic text \nsummarization using spacy  \nSummarization of large texts has become a pivotal task in natural language processing \n(NLP) and has garnered significant attention in both academic research and \ncommercial applications. In recent years, the field of text summarization has witnessed \nsignifi cant advancements, driven by the integration of deep learning models and NLP \ntechniques. This article explores the state of the art in automatic text summarization, \nwith a focus on summarization techniques, challenges, and the role of libraires like \nSpaCy.  With the two different methods of summarization i.e., extractive, and \nabstractive summarization. A method utilizing K -Means clustering for sentence \nselection in extractive method was introduced which involves in preprocessing the \ninput text by removing th e stop words, hyphens, and extra spaces followed by n -grams \nto select the features and applying clustering techniques.  \n3.3.1.  Summarization Techniques  \nAn unsupervised framework called SummCoder for extractive summarization was \nintroduced that employs a scoring system, considering sentence content relevance, \nsentence novelty, and sentence position relevance, to select sentences for the \nsummary. A graph -based extraction system was introduced in the paper that utilizes \nthe nouns as nodes and non -nouns words as edge. This approach considers the \nrelationship between nouns and selects the sentences based on prominence of nouns, \nachieving effective sentence extr action.  \nThe paper also suggests that abstractive summarization methods are more \nchallenging but hold the promise of creating more human -like summaries. Zheng and \nLapata proposed PacSumm, which employs a graph -based rank algorithm and utilizes \nBERT (Bidirectional E ncoder Representation from Transformers) for representation \nmapping which leverages transformer -based model to create abstractive summaries \nby considering the relationships between sentences.  \n3.3.2.  Spacy in Text Summarization  \nThe automatic text summarization with the above techniques faced challenges \nparticularly with abstractive summarization. However, the recent advancements in \ndeep learning have improved. SpaCy is an open -source NLP library in Python, that \nplays a significan t role in text summarization and sentence extraction. It offers a range 6CS007  \n12 \n of NLP functionalities, including tokenization, part -of-speech tagging, parsing, and \nnamed entity recognition. These features are essential for the preprocessing and \nunderstanding the structure of the input text. It supports deep learning workflows with \nmodels compatible with PyTorch and TensoFlow. It provides accurate parsing, \nsentence boundary detection and access to the word vectors making it a valuable tool \nfor researchers and developers working on text summarization projects.  \n3.3.3.  Discussion  \nThe text summarization process in this article follows several key steps. The initial \nphase involves preparing the input text for the summarization. This addresses the \nissues commonly found in unstructured text, such as line breaks, special characters, \nunwanted spaces, and punctuation. Then, the stop words are removed which are the \nwords which contribute little meaning are eliminated. After the removal of stop words, \ntokenization is performed which splits the sentences into individual words, forming \ntokens.  Then the selection and extraction of significant sentences from the \npreprocessed text is performed. This step involves frequency analysis, weight \ncalculation of each word determined by dividing frequency by maximum frequency. \nKey phrases in the input text  are reviewed and sentences are scored by summing \nweighted frequencies of word then the token list is sorted in descending order based \non scores. The sentences with the highest score are selected for inclusion in the final \nsummary. This method is further i ntegrated with NLP frameworks using libraries like \nSpaCy which enables efficient extraction of informative summaries (Nayana, et al., \n2022) . \n \nFigure 4 Architecture for text summarization using SpaCy (Nayana, et al., 2022)  \n6CS007  \n13 \n 3.4. Automatic Text Summarization Using Gensim Word2Vec \nand K -Means Clustering Algorithm  \n3.4.1.  Introduction  \nThis paper gives us two necessary approaches for text summarization which are \nextractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive involves choosing relevant \nsentences, paragraphs, or phrases directly from the source and then summarizing it. \nOn the other h and, abstractive creates new sentences by rephrasing the original text \nusing words that are not in the source document. The primary objective of this research \nis to summarize single documents using a sentence -based model with clustering. The \nstudy leverage s Gensim Word2Vec for feature extraction, aiming to identify the main \nconcept across the sentences.  \nThe model proposed by this paper is primarily a sentence -based clustering approach \nfor summarizing news articles. The BBC news article dataset consisting of 2,225 news \narticles were categorized into five groups (business, entertainment, politics, sport, an d \ntech) which were used for the research. To prepare the data for analysis, sentences \nwere first tokenized where text was divided into sentences using NLTK library. \nUnnecessary characters were removed, commonly occurring stop words were \neliminated, duplica te words within each sentence were removed retaining only one \ninstance and then words in the text were lemmatized to obtain their root forms.  \n3.4.2.  Word2Vec  \nWord2Vec, a widely used word embedding technique in neural networks, was \nemployed. Word2Vec method involves two terms: Skip Gram and Common Bag of \nWords (CBOW). For the implementation method, Skip Gram was chosen due to its \neffectiveness with small data am ounts and uncommon words. CBOW takes meaning \nof each word from the file and tires to predict the target word using single context input. \nThis technique generated vector representations for each word, with similar words \nhaving closer spatial positions (Karani, 2018) .  \nsin(𝑋,𝑌)= cos(𝜃)=(𝑋.𝑌)\n||𝑋|| ||𝑌|| \n 6CS007  \n14 \n 3.4.3.  Gensim Word2Vec  \nAnother open -source library for unsupervised learning is Gensim, which uses \nWord2Vec to create word vectors from tokenized word lists based on Latent Dirichlet \nAllocation (LDA).  \n3.4.4.  K-Means Clustering  \nData points with comparable characteristics were grouped into groups using K -Means \nclustering. K -Means seeks to reduce the squared distance between each data point \nand the cluster center. Below is an algorithmic representation of K -Means.  \nLet M = {m1, m2, m3,….,mn} be collection of data points and V = {v1, v2, v3,..., vc} \nare the centers.  \n1. A cluster of the center named c was chosen at random.  \n2. The distinction between a cluster center and a single data point is established.  \n3. Cluster center datapoints are assigned to cluster centers within the shortest travel \ntime.  \n4. The following factors are used to identify the new center of cluster:  \n𝑣𝑖=(1)\n(𝑐𝑖)∑𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑖\n𝑗=1 \n1. New cluster centers are found by recalculating the distance between each data \npoint.  \n2. If there is no reallocated data point, step 3 is repeated. (Ortega, et al., 2009) . \n3.4.5.  Elbow Method to find k  \nThe ideal value of k, which stands for the number of clusters used in the model, was \nfound using the elbow approach. The final step involved generating the summary. The \ncluster with the highest number of sentences, indicating the most valuable sentences, \nwas selected.  \nThe steps to follow elbow method.  \n1. The range of K is 1 to 9.  \n2. Here, the value of k is  Increased  by 1.  6CS007  \n15 \n Third, calculate the distortion.  \n4. The point at which the distortion starts to linearly decrease.   \n \nFigure 5 The elbow with k =2 in business_doc_465 (Haider, et al., 2020)  \n3.4.6.  Evaluation  \nThe Word2Vec model was used to calculate the mean similarity of the sentences \ninside the cluster while taking noun and number content into account. The sentences \nwere chosen to produce a summary of the original text that was one -third as long. Two \ntexts ha ve been compared using the BELU score. The score for each category of the \nnews article in the image below, from lowest to highest, is calculated using BELU. The \nmodel for the business article outperformed the others. For business items, the highest \nBELU sc ore was 0.894 (Haider, et al., 2020) .  \n \nFigure 6 BELU Score for business article (Haider, et al., 2020)  \n6CS007  \n16 \n  \nFigure 7 Summary score comparison between news article categories (Haider, et al., 2020)  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6CS007  \n17 \n 3.5. Speed Reading Tool Powered by Artificial Intelligence for \nStudents with ADHD, Dyslexia, or Short Attention Span  \nThe paper reveals that the development of AI -based solutions to improve reading \ncomprehension and speed among the people with ADHD (Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder) or dyslexia has represented great advancement in the sector \nof education and acces sibility. Although there have been traditional speed -reading \nmethods, they frequently need substantial training and practice. However, many \nresearches and developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural \nLanguage Processing (NLP) have paved a way for the development of AI powered \nspeed -reading tools that can automatically summarize the texts facilitating efficient \ninformation intake.  \n3.5.1.  T5 Model  \nThe proposed model discussed in this paper uses a pre -trained model to generate \nsummaries of the input text. The tool includes features such as custom bolding feature, \nhighlighting the important information and feature to adjust the line, word and characte r \nspacing in the tool for custom reading preference. The pretrained model used by this \ntool is T5 (Text -to-Text Transfer Transformer) provided by Transformers library, a \nmodel from Hugging Face. The model was further fine -tuned to allow generate \naccurate a nd personalized summaries (Raffel, et al., 2020) .  \n3.5.2.  Transformer Architecture  \nThe transformer architecture was introduced by Vaswani and their colleague in their \ngroundbreaking paper named “Attention is All You Need” in 2017 that has \nrevolutionized use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its tasks (Vaswani, et \nal., 2017) . The core concept of this architecture lies in self -attention, often referred to \nas scaled dot -product attention, enabling the model to weigh the importance of the \ndifferent words in a sequence when processing specific words.  \n3.5.3.  Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs)  \nThe transformer architecture is incorporated with Feedforward Neural Networks that \nplays a pivotal role in the processing and generating expressive representations. The \nencoder and decoder layers of the Transformer compute the attention score for each \ntoken in the data entered which is the input sequence. The outputs from the self -\nattention layer are channeled through FFNNs which consists of two linear 6CS007  \n18 \n transformations, which is often followed by a non -linear activation function such as \nRectified Linear Unit (ReLU), introducing non -linearity and enabling complex pattern \nand relationship learning within the data.  \n3.5.4.  Tool Implementation  \nIn implementing AI -based speed -reading tool, T5 tokenizer is set to “t5 -base” which \nhandles the sequences with a maximum of 512 tokens and T5 model is loaded with \n“t5-base” for summarization. To manage long paragraphs, the text is divided into \nsmaller 512 -token chunks, ensuring the summarization process retains important \ninformation. The system uses Flask as the development framework, which is a \nlightweight web server framework to handle user input, process the text and apply the \nalgorithms from the python script. For the interface the proposed tool uses HTML, \nCSS, and JavaScript to display the summarized information. The below figure is a \nscreenshot of the user interface of the summarizing too l (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023).   \n \nFigure 8 Summarizing user interface (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023)  \n \n \n \n \n \n6CS007  \n19 \n 3.6. Hybrid Long Document Summarization using C2F -FAR and \nChatGPT: A Practical Study  \nLong Document summarization has drawn a lot of attention nowadays in the field of \ninformation retrieval. The development of cutting -edge language models like C2F -FAR \nand ChatGPT has created new opportunities for exploring the real -world uses of hybrid \nsumm arization pipelines. This paper gives significant research initiatives and \nadvancements in lengthy document summarization and focuses on the advantages \nand difficulties of the hybrid approaches used in this paper.  \nDue to the extensive amount of information and the need for consistency and integrity \nin the summaries, long documents have issues while summarizing because of large \namount of information and the need of coherence summaries. Traditional extractive \nmethods tend to struggle with generating coherent and concise summaries. Large \nlanguage models like ChatGPT enable abstractive approaches addressing the \nchallenges but also have problems with content hallucination and stylistic \ninconsistencies.  \n3.6.1.  C2F-FAR \nIn this paper, C2F -FAR (Content -to-flow Extractive Facilitated Abstractive \nsummarization) was introduced that offers an extractive summarization approach for \nlong documents. It relies on sentence extraction to identify key information, aiming to \nenhance th e summaries. The study shows that C2F -FAR can generate summaries \nwith competitive automated metrics, indicating its potential as a basis for hybrid \nsummarization. It can automatically select sentences from a document by considering \nthe semantics similarity  between blocks of text and between different sentences. The \nbelow figure illustrates the application of default C2F -FAR settings to 20 cleaned \narticles, demonstrating that the number of blocks partitions generally increases with \nthe number of sentences in  an article which shows that the model can automatically \ncapture semantic blocks in text.  6CS007  \n20 \n  \nFigure 9 Testing C2F -FAR default settings on 20 articles (Lu, et al., 2023).  \n \n3.6.2.  ChatGPT  \nThe research also focused on utilizing ChatGPT for summarization, specifically in the \ncontext of extractive summaries generated by C2F -FAR with a particular emphasis on \nlong documents. The summarization process involved in the two -step prompting \nmethod gen erally yielded satisfactory summary length compared to human written \nsummaries. However, repeated requests for additional details led to irrelevancy. \nThese summarizations were performed based on GPT -3.5, except for the final test \nusing GPT -4 for summarizin g the entire book.  \n3.6.3.  Evaluation  \nFor the evaluation, automated metrics such as ROGUE and BERT Score were used \nwhich suggested that machine -generated summaries are equivalent with the human \nwritten ones. The evaluation of summarization pipeline involved both human and \nautomated metrics. Hu man evaluations reveal critical issues related to coherence, \nfaithfulness, and style. The below figure shows the paraphrasing ability of ChatGPT \nagainst C2F -FAR extracted sentences using 20 cleaned articles.  \n \nFigure 10 Evaluation of article summarizes with various metrics (Lu, et al., 2023).  \n6CS007  \n21 \n In the figure above, when ChatGPT paraphrases sentences extracted by C2F -FAR, it \nleads to slightly lower ROGUE -1 and BALANC scores, but a slightly higher BERT \nScore compared to C2F -FAR generated summaries. ROGUE -2 and ROGUE -L scores \nremain largely unchange d. However, paraphrasing introduces new words to convey \nthe same meaning resulting in higher ESTIME alarms and lower ESTIME soft values \ncompared to C2F -FAR generated summaries. Despite this, ChatGPT’s ESTIME \nalarms value remains lower than human written su mmaries and ESTIME soft value \nremains higher. In conclusion, ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to rewrite text to \nsome extent while maintaining overall summary quality (Lu, et al., 2023).  \n4. Project Methodology  \n4.1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  \n \nFigure 11 Work breakdown structure  \n \n4.2. Software Development Methodology  \nTo organize the software development cycle, Kanban Methodology will be used. \nKanban is a method used to manage and optimize workflows in project management \nby emphasizing visual work, limiting work in progress, and promoting continuous \nimprovement. Choosin g Kanban for individual software development offers distinct \nadvantages over other SDLC methodologies. Kanban allows high flexibility as it deals \nwith prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency since solo developers \noften face quick change in  priority. It encourages a constant flow of deliverables \n6CS007  \n22 \n leading to quicker feedback. It allows individual developers to manage their work in a \nway that suits their own pace and style, as it does not have a predefined iteration like \nScrum, allowing them not to spend time on detailed planning sessions or assignin g \ntasks (Raut, 2015).  \n \n \n \nFigure 12 Glimpse to Trello  \nTrello will be utilized to follow the Kanban method, utilizing its visual card -based \nsystem for effective task and project management. Trello was launched in 2011, \nattributed to user friendly design and adaptability which helped it in gaining popularity. \nIn Trello, the tasks are visualized as cards or sticky notes on a visual board which is \nkanban and, usually divided into columns that represent different stages of the \nworkflow, such as ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’ and ‘Done’. These cards are movable across \nthe c olumns to reflect the progress of the work (Johnson, 2021) .  \n4.3. Evidence of Project Management  \n4.3.1.  Project Milestones Achieved  \nThe project Document to Text Summarization using AI has made substantial progress \nin delivering a functional system. Since the whole project was divided into several \nsystems, which includes User Management System, Document Management System, \nSummarization System, and Database System. It was easier to work on each \nfunctional system. The project initiated with the implementation of Kanban \nmethodology using Trello proved to be a highly effective approach for managing this \n6CS007  \n23 \n project. Trello provided me with the visual organization of the project, and with the help \nof automation, I was able to organize tasks, track progress and adapt to changing \npriorities seamlessly.  \n4.3.2.  Sprint Planning  \n4.3.2.1.  Initial Phase  \nThe project was initiated with the research and design phase. In the research phase, \nindividual research, literature reviews, survey forms and reviewing other systems \nhelped me picturize the system. With the initial requirement and research, I was able \nto design a basic wireframe and then give a brand theme and identity to my Lo -Fi \ndesign where I improved my wireframes and prepared Hi -Fi UI designs with a theme \nthat followed the color, typography, and basic layout of the system. While surveying \nthe system, I was able to gather the challenges and scenarios where this system can \nbe useful.  \n \nFigure 13 Sample survey 1  \n \nFigure 14 Sample survey 2  \n6CS007  \n24 \n 4.3.2.2.  Development Phase  \nThe development phase was initiated with the use of GitHub from August 20, 2023, \nhere I was able to work with the Django framework for the system development where \nwith the assigned tasks in Trello for Sprint 1, related to User Management followed by \nthe d evelopment on login, signup and logout were performed. Along with user \nmanagement, Document Management System and Database Management System \nwere successfully established. Here, authentication features for users, profile \nfunctionalities, uploading and stor ing documents were developed. The work on API \nbased summarization was done from implementing the summarization in Notebook to \nintegrating it to the system. At the end of Sprint 1, initiation of research and \ndevelopment on Summarization System was done. The  progress on the development \nis demonstrated below with the help of GitHub insights.  \n \nFigure 15 Work insight in GitHub  for contributions  \nFor Sprint 2, major updates in the development done in Sprint 1 were performed where \nfirstly, forgotten password authentication, popup modal, upgrading the frontend, use \nof messages and other tasks were performed. The issues in implementing API were \nconcerned.  \nTo track every task is going seamlessly as planned in the Gantt Chart, proper \noptimization and use of GitHub, Trello Board and Meeting Minutes were done.  \n6CS007  \n25 \n  \nFigure 16 Commits track in GitHub  \n \n5. Different Technologies and Tools Used  \n5.1. HTML/ CSS/ JS  \nHTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for front -end development for this system, where \nHTML helps in structuring the content where CSS helps in defining the visual \nrepresentation of the HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and attractive design. \nSimilarly, JavaScript helps in adding interactivity, enabling dynamic content updates \nand enhancing the user engagement.  \n5.2. Django Framework  \nDjango Framework was chosen for backend due to my familiarity with Python \nlanguage. Django is known for its effectiveness in handling web applications. It is a \nfree and open -source web framework for Python that accelerates the development of \nweb applicatio ns. It offers a more effective method to build and develop web programs \nthat initiating from scratch because it removes the need to build the backend, APIs, \nJavaScript (IBM, 2023) .  \n5.3. MariaDB  \nTo store the data, MariaDB will be used due to its user -friendly interface simplifies \ndatabase management, making it an excellent choice for an uncomplicated database \nsolution.  \n6CS007  \n26 \n 5.4. NLP Model  \nNLP model is the proposed model that will be used for the machine learning aspect of \nthe system. TextRank is one of the algorithms that extracts important sentences from \na document. Similarly for the proposed system, transformer -based models such as \nBERT a nd BART could be used for abstractive summarization (Pietro, 2022) . \n \n6. Artefact Designs  \n6.1.

Gantt Chart  \n1.2.1.  Proposed Gantt Chart  \nBelow is a proposed Gantt Chart of the overall timeline of the project. Here the project \ntimeline is divided into six phases. The first phase is the phase of project initiation \nwhere the requirement gathering, research and proposal is prepared for the project. \nBased on the first phase the second phase starts with the basic vis ualization of the \noverall system through wireframing and creating the User Interface (UI) and User \nExperience (UX) of the system. After this, the phase of development kicks off with the \nintegration of API in a crude system without a frontend. The evaluatio n of the API \nsystem will be conducted and then the NLP model will be developed which includes \nthe preprocessing, model architecture design, model training, and fine tuning of the \nsystem. The model will then be displayed after the front -end development and the \nbackend development will help in setting up the backend with database integration. \nFinally, a final documentation of the whole project will be done accordingly as shown \nin the Gantt Chart below.  \n \nFigure 34 Proposed Gantt Chart  \n6CS007  \n57 \n 1.2.2.

This project presents a dynamic solution to address the challenge of information overload by leveraging advanced technologies. The project imposes the development of a web-based platform that encompasses a range of functionalities to simplify the summarization process including user registration, document upload, summary display. The system will be using NLP algorithms and will also be offering an API-based summarization model. The development methodology adopted for this project is the Kanban approach, providing a flexible and responsive framework. The tools and technologies that will be used are Django framework, with frontend HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Similarly, the summaries generated by the system will be stored in the MariaDB database for easy access and retrieval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: Document Summarization, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Textual Data, Web Application, Information Extraction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement\r\n\r\nI would like to express, sincere gratitude to the individuals and institutions that have played an important role in the successful initiation of the final year project.

Due to the large amount of data, individuals and organizations face the challenges of managing vast amounts of textual data, including lengthy documents, research papers, and articles. Extracting essential insights from these documents is a time consuming and resource intensive task. The proposed document summarization tool aims to address the problem by leveraging NLP and machine learning techniques. \r\n\r\nAims and Objectives\r\n\r\nAims\r\n\r\nTo develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based document summarization model.\r\n\r\nTo create a tool for summarizing lengthy documents, research papers, and articles.\r\n\r\nTo provide the users with concise summaries for improved content comprehension.\r\n\r\nTo improve efficiency in learning and reading contents.\r\n\r\nTo save time and increase interest in reading document-based contents.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\nA web application will be created that will allow users to input documents and get summaries generated.\r\n\r\nNatural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy technology will be used to handle document parsing and processing for various formats.\r\n\r\nA suitable Natural Language Processing (NLP) summarization model will be chosen.\r\n\r\nThe summarized set of documents will then be stored in the database from the documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtefact\r\n\r\nThe proposed artifacts outline the components and features for document to text summarization system. The system comprises different subsystems, each with specific functionalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1 Functional Decomposition Diagram (FDD)\r\n\r\n		\r\n\r\nFrontend System\r\n\r\nUser Registration\r\n\r\nThis will be the first user interaction, which will allow the user to register by creating a user account and login with their credentials. Here, the user needs to provide their basic information to access the system.\r\n\r\nDocument Upload\r\n\r\nUsers can interact with the system by uploading documents they wish to summarize. This feature provides users to input the documents into the system.\r\n\r\nSummary Display\r\n\r\nAfter the document is uploaded, this feature will play an important role in displaying the summarized data to the user.\r\n\r\n1.3.2. NLP Subsystem\r\n\r\n1.3.2.1. API Based Summarizer\r\n\r\nThis functionality will integrate an external summarization API from hugging face or any reliable source which will allow summarizing any kind of documents.\r\n\r\n1.3.2.2. NLP Summarizer\r\n\r\nThis system will be trained with data especially for a specific kind of text-based file such as a book and will summarize the contents based on its specific feature.\r\n\r\n1.3.3. Backend Subsystem\r\n\r\n1.3.3.1. Database Management\r\n\r\nThe system will use MariaDB to manage data storage and will be storing user information, uploaded documents and generated summaries allowing the users to access and review the summaries of their uploaded documents whenever they need.\r\n\r\n1.3.3.2. API Management \r\n\r\nThis functionality will be involved in managing the data fetched from the API and will be helping in allowing the external summarization API.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademic Question\r\n\r\nHow does the tool address the problem of information and time-consuming content review?\r\n\r\nWhat are the potential benefits of using NLP and machine learning algorithms in the summarization process?\r\n\r\nWhat existing NLP algorithms and approaches will be used to automate the text summarization?\r\n\r\nWhat techniques will be used to handle document parsing and processing for document format (e.g., PDF)?\r\n\r\nScope and Limitations\r\n\r\nScope \r\n\r\nThe major scope of this application is that it can summarize pdf-based documents including research papers, articles, and textual content. \r\n\r\nIt will be able to identify key points, findings, and contextual information from lengthy documents.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nSummarization algorithms may not capture the complete context of a document.\r\n\r\nThe tool will be limited to cross-language summarization feature.\r\n\r\nThe tool focuses on text-based documents and may not be able to effectively handle images, charts, and videos.\r\n\r\nThe summarizer might be limited to certain word count.\r\n\r\nProblem Statement\r\n\r\nDue to the expansion in digital information, a challenge of information overloading has been seen. Dealing with lengthy documents and research materials becomes time consuming, hindering the ability to extract crucial information quickly. A study published in Nature Communication reveals that our collective attention span is narrowing. This is not just on social media but also in different domains, that people are losing their attention span (Lorenz-Spreen, et al., 2019). Due to the low attention span, most individuals are not likely to read journals, books, and other documented files. The rise of audio-visual content has also impacted the consumption of text-based information. These days the way of consuming information has changed which is a positive thing but in context of a person with academic background in performing research based on text-based documents, one of the pain-points I have been facing is analyzing and curating the contents from lengthy documents. In the professional world, handling and extracting major key points from proposals and documents could be a terrible task for working individuals until there is a summarization tool that makes the task easier.\r\n\r\nProject as Solution\r\n\r\nProfessionals, researchers, and students face challenges of extracting content from research papers and journals. This summarization tool will extract important insights from a paper to make informed decisions quickly. Dealing with lengthy documents that require significant time and effort is a terrible task, the project will be able to minimize the time required and will prioritize important documents. This tool will help streamline the process of summarizing and aggregating information from multiple sources and will store it for further usage of the user. People will be able to access necessary content in a short format, saving time. It will encourage continuous learning by allowing users to explore a broader range of topics within a shorter time frame.\r\n\r\nInitial Research\r\n\r\nHugging Face\r\n\r\nHugging Face is a platform for data science and machine learning which was initially developed in 2017 as a chatbot app for teenagers but has expanded its domain from just a chatbot app. This platform has a range of functionalities from creating, hosting, and managing their own AI models to engaging in discussions and collaborations within the platform. Hugging face also holds a substantial collection of models and datasets created by the collaborators and users. This platform encompasses a range of AI applications like computer vision, audio analysis, and natural language processing (Rebelo, 2023).\r\n\r\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\r\n\r\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a division of AI that aims to make computers comprehend, analyze, and produce human language. NLP plays and significant role in extracting the most meaningful information. NLP encompasses various techniques and methods to process and understand human language. The division of NLP approaches extractive and abstractive summarization, along with other categories such as single-document, multi-document, and query-based summarization.\r\n\r\nAbstractive Summarization\r\n\r\nAbstractive summarization is a method where the generated summary doesn’t necessarily consist of sentences present in the original text, instead it creates new sentences that capture the key concepts. This is a approach where the new texts are generated only after abstracting and understanding the semantic meaning of the text while capturing the key concepts of the original content.\r\n\r\nExtractive Summarization \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Extractive summarization involves choosing sentences directly from the source text to create a concise summarization. Then the chosen text based content is typically chosen based on its importance and relevance. This method aims to retain the original wording from the text, making it more conservative approach to summarization (Adhikari, et al., 2020). \r\n\r\nLiterature Review\r\n\r\nNLP Based Text Summarization Using Semantic Analysis\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nText Summarization is a supervised learning method, that heavily relies on Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps in generating concise and comprehensive summaries from massive number of text-based inputs. \r\n\r\nThis literature review focuses on the research paper titled “NLP Based Text Summarization Using Sematic Analysis” which introduces an innovative approach for specific text summarization. To save manual effort in information processing, the study discusses the challenges of summarizing large texts and highlights the use of automatic summarization tools. The author offers a method based on Semantic Analysis, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps in extracting representative sentences and generates meaningful summaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n\r\nThe proposed methodology in this research paper leverages a technique based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for text summarization. LSA is used to extract semantically important sentences and generate a summary of the input text. First, the input document undergoes data preprocessing method, where irrelevant words such as stop, words are removed to enhance the quality of the summary. A matrix of word counts is constructed from preprocessed text, representing the occurrence of words across sentences. The sentence matrix undergoes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce dimensionality and identify the latent semantic structure of the text. This helps in identifying the most noticeable feature of the document, enabling extraction of meaningful sentences for summary. Based on latent semantic structure, the system identifies the most relevant sentence and arranges them in a coherent manner to generate the final summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2  Proposed System (Moiyadi, et al., 2016)\r\n\r\nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used for identifying the most important sentences in a text document. Below is the mathematical equation for the LSA method. \r\n\r\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD)\r\n\r\nSVD is used to factorize the term-document matrix into three matrices: u, ∑, and v\r\n\r\nu, s, v = svds (matrix, k= num_concepts)\r\n\r\nSaliency Vector Calculation\r\n\r\nThe saliency of each sentence is calculated as the dot product of the squared values in u and v.\r\n\r\nsaliency_vec = np.dot (np.square(u), np.square(v))\r\n\r\nTopic Filtering \r\n\r\nSingular values below a certain threshold controlled by topic_sigma_threshold are set to zero to filter out less significant topics.\r\n\r\nu [u < sigma_threshold] = 0\r\n\r\nTop Sentence Selection \r\n\r\nThe top sentences are selected based on their saliency scores.\r\n\r\ntop_sentences = saliency_vec.argsort() [-length:] [:: -1]\r\n\r\nHere, the code implements Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to perform text summarization. First the input text is preprocessed, and a term-document matrix is generated. Then SVD is applied to identify the important topics and sentences and at last the salient sentences are selected to create a summary.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nThe authors applied LSA-based summarization technique to a diverse set of texts and evaluated the performance of generated summaries. They measured the quality of the summaries using various metrics, including ROUGE scores, F1-score, and precision-recall curves. The study indicates that LSA approach performed better than existing summarization techniques (Moiyadi, et al., 2016). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurvey on NLP based automatic extractive text summarization using Spacy\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThis article provides a general overview of the area of NLP-based automated text summarization. It seeks to discuss and evaluate frequently used summarizing techniques by the researchers with an emphasis on useful and successful tactics with an insight into the evolution of summarization. The major key points that the article discusses are the difficulties of numerically evaluating the quality of summary and the distinctions between extractive and abstractive summarization.\r\n\r\nThe article offers a comprehensive examination of text summarization, tracing its evolution from early IBM research in 1950s to modern methods. The authors delve into the fundamental ideas behind extractive summarizing techniques, putting special emphasis on the importance of elements like key phrase recognition and sentence positioning during the summarization procedure. These methods are considered as the pillars that support the development of contemporary extractive summarization approaches.\r\n\r\nNLP and Ambiguity \r\n\r\nText summarization and other applications, such as language translation and chatbots, rely heavily on NLP, which emphasizes its importance in comprehending and interpreting human language. NLP is complicated because natural language is often unclear and uncertain. There are different types of uncertainties in language: Lexical ambiguity; that occurs when a single word has multiple meanings. Syntactic ambiguity: this occurs from the way words are structured in sentences. For instance, the phrase “Visiting relatives can be tedious” can have two different interpretations. Lastly, semantic ambiguity: this occurs when the meaning of words themselves are unclear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhases of Natural Language Processing \r\n\r\nThe article claims that the phases of NLP including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, discourse integration and pragmatic analysis help in analyzing ambiguities. Lexical analysis is the first step where the sentences are divided into tokens. For the second step, syntactic analysis or parsing is performed, where the word order is studied then in semantic analysis meaning and word order is analyzed. After performing discourse integration, pragmatic analysis is performed which is the last stage, where real impact of text is gained. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3 Phases of Natural Language Processing (Prakash, et al., 2022).\r\n\r\nPreprocessing\r\n\r\nTo retrieve valid information, pre-processing steps in text summarization are depicted in the article including sentence separation, stop words removal, stemming, part-of speech tagging and keyword extraction. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe authors make recommendations for potential future text summarizing research. They draw attention to the fact that it can be difficult to reach consensus between multiple annotators and that we need more effective tools to automatically verify text summaries. This demonstrates how the industry is developing and working towards more effective automatic text summarization systems (Prakash, et al., 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementation of NLP based on automatic text summarization using spacy\r\n\r\nSummarization of large texts has become a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP) and has garnered significant attention in both academic research and commercial applications. In recent years, the field of text summarization has witnessed significant advancements, driven by the integration of deep learning models and NLP techniques. This article explores the state of the art in automatic text summarization, with a focus on summarization techniques, challenges, and the role of libraires like SpaCy. With the two different methods of summarization i.e., extractive, and abstractive summarization. A method utilizing K-Means clustering for sentence selection in extractive method was introduced which involves in preprocessing the input text by removing the stop words, hyphens, and extra spaces followed by n-grams to select the features and applying clustering techniques. \r\n\r\nSummarization Techniques\r\n\r\nAn unsupervised framework called SummCoder for extractive summarization was introduced that employs a scoring system, considering sentence content relevance, sentence novelty, and sentence position relevance, to select sentences for the summary. A graph-based extraction system was introduced in the paper that utilizes the nouns as nodes and non-nouns words as edge. This approach considers the relationship between nouns and selects the sentences based on prominence of nouns, achieving effective sentence extraction. \r\n\r\nThe paper also suggests that abstractive summarization methods are more challenging but hold the promise of creating more human-like summaries. Zheng and Lapata proposed PacSumm, which employs a graph-based rank algorithm and utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) for representation mapping which leverages transformer-based model to create abstractive summaries by considering the relationships between sentences.\r\n\r\nSpacy in Text Summarization\r\n\r\nThe automatic text summarization with the above techniques faced challenges particularly with abstractive summarization. However, the recent advancements in deep learning have improved. SpaCy is an open-source NLP library in Python, that plays a significant role in text summarization and sentence extraction. It offers a range of NLP functionalities, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and named entity recognition. These features are essential for the preprocessing and understanding the structure of the input text. It supports deep learning workflows with models compatible with PyTorch and TensoFlow. It provides accurate parsing, sentence boundary detection and access to the word vectors making it a valuable tool for researchers and developers working on text summarization projects. \r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nThe text summarization process in this article follows several key steps. The initial phase involves preparing the input text for the summarization. This addresses the issues commonly found in unstructured text, such as line breaks, special characters, unwanted spaces, and punctuation. Then, the stop words are removed which are the words which contribute little meaning are eliminated. After the removal of stop words, tokenization is performed which splits the sentences into individual words, forming tokens. Then the selection and extraction of significant sentences from the preprocessed text is performed. This step involves frequency analysis, weight calculation of each word determined by dividing frequency by maximum frequency. Key phrases in the input text are reviewed and sentences are scored by summing weighted frequencies of word then the token list is sorted in descending order based on scores. The sentences with the highest score are selected for inclusion in the final summary. This method is further integrated with NLP frameworks using libraries like SpaCy which enables efficient extraction of informative summaries (Nayana, et al., 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4 Architecture for text summarization using SpaCy (Nayana, et al., 2022)\r\n\r\nAutomatic Text Summarization Using Gensim Word2Vec and K-Means Clustering Algorithm\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThis paper gives us two necessary approaches for text summarization which are extractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive involves choosing relevant sentences, paragraphs, or phrases directly from the source and then summarizing it. On the other hand, abstractive creates new sentences by rephrasing the original text using words that are not in the source document. The primary objective of this research is to summarize single documents using a sentence-based model with clustering. The study leverages Gensim Word2Vec for feature extraction, aiming to identify the main concept across the sentences.\r\n\r\nThe model proposed by this paper is primarily a sentence-based clustering approach for summarizing news articles. The BBC news article dataset consisting of 2,225 news articles were categorized into five groups (business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech) which were used for the research. To prepare the data for analysis, sentences were first tokenized where text was divided into sentences using NLTK library. Unnecessary characters were removed, commonly occurring stop words were eliminated, duplicate words within each sentence were removed retaining only one instance and then words in the text were lemmatized to obtain their root forms.\r\n\r\nWord2Vec\r\n\r\nWord2Vec, a widely used word embedding technique in neural networks, was employed. Word2Vec method involves two terms: Skip Gram and Common Bag of Words (CBOW). For the implementation method, Skip Gram was chosen due to its effectiveness with small data amounts and uncommon words. CBOW takes meaning of each word from the file and tires to predict the target word using single context input. This technique generated vector representations for each word, with similar words having closer spatial positions (Karani, 2018). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGensim Word2Vec\r\n\r\nAnother open-source library for unsupervised learning is Gensim, which uses Word2Vec to create word vectors from tokenized word lists based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\r\n\r\nK-Means Clustering\r\n\r\nData points with comparable characteristics were grouped into groups using K-Means clustering. K-Means seeks to reduce the squared distance between each data point and the cluster center. Below is an algorithmic representation of K-Means.\r\n\r\nLet M = {m1, m2, m3,….,mn} be collection of data points and V = {v1, v2, v3,..., vc} are the centers. \r\n\r\n1. A cluster of the center named c was chosen at random.\r\n\r\n2. The distinction between a cluster center and a single data point is established.\r\n\r\n3. Cluster center datapoints are assigned to cluster centers within the shortest travel time.\r\n\r\n4. The following factors are used to identify the new center of cluster:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew cluster centers are found by recalculating the distance between each data point.\r\n\r\nIf there is no reallocated data point, step 3 is repeated. (Ortega, et al., 2009).\r\n\r\nElbow Method to find k\r\n\r\nThe ideal value of k, which stands for the number of clusters used in the model, was found using the elbow approach. The final step involved generating the summary. The cluster with the highest number of sentences, indicating the most valuable sentences, was selected. \r\n\r\nThe steps to follow elbow method.\r\n\r\n1. The range of K is 1 to 9.\r\n\r\n2. Here, the value of k is Increased by 1.\r\n\r\nThird, calculate the distortion. \r\n\r\n4. The point at which the distortion starts to linearly decrease. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5 The elbow with k =2 in business_doc_465 (Haider, et al., 2020)\r\n\r\nEvaluation\r\n\r\nThe Word2Vec model was used to calculate the mean similarity of the sentences inside the cluster while taking noun and number content into account. The sentences were chosen to produce a summary of the original text that was one-third as long. Two texts have been compared using the BELU score. The score for each category of the news article in the image below, from lowest to highest, is calculated using BELU. The model for the business article outperformed the others. For business items, the highest BELU score was 0.894 (Haider, et al., 2020). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6 BELU Score for business article (Haider, et al., 2020)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7 Summary score comparison between news article categories (Haider, et al., 2020)\r\n\r\n		\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed Reading Tool Powered by Artificial Intelligence for Students with ADHD, Dyslexia, or Short Attention Span \r\n\r\nThe paper reveals that the development of AI-based solutions to improve reading comprehension and speed among the people with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) or dyslexia has represented great advancement in the sector of education and accessibility. Although there have been traditional speed-reading methods, they frequently need substantial training and practice. However, many researches and developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have paved a way for the development of AI powered speed-reading tools that can automatically summarize the texts facilitating efficient information intake. \r\n\r\nT5 Model\r\n\r\nThe proposed model discussed in this paper uses a pre-trained model to generate summaries of the input text. The tool includes features such as custom bolding feature, highlighting the important information and feature to adjust the line, word and character spacing in the tool for custom reading preference. The pretrained model used by this tool is T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) provided by Transformers library, a model from Hugging Face. The model was further fine-tuned to allow generate accurate and personalized summaries (Raffel, et al., 2020). \r\n\r\nTransformer Architecture \r\n\r\nThe transformer architecture was introduced by Vaswani and their colleague in their groundbreaking paper named “Attention is All You Need” in 2017 that has revolutionized use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its tasks (Vaswani, et al., 2017). The core concept of this architecture lies in self-attention, often referred to as scaled dot-product attention, enabling the model to weigh the importance of the different words in a sequence when processing specific words. \r\n\r\nFeedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs)\r\n\r\nThe transformer architecture is incorporated with Feedforward Neural Networks that plays a pivotal role in the processing and generating expressive representations. The encoder and decoder layers of the Transformer compute the attention score for each token in the data entered which is the input sequence. The outputs from the self-attention layer are channeled through FFNNs which consists of two linear transformations, which is often followed by a non-linear activation function such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), introducing non-linearity and enabling complex pattern and relationship learning within the data.\r\n\r\nTool Implementation\r\n\r\nIn implementing AI-based speed-reading tool, T5 tokenizer is set to “t5-base” which handles the sequences with a maximum of 512 tokens and T5 model is loaded with “t5-base” for summarization. To manage long paragraphs, the text is divided into smaller 512-token chunks, ensuring the summarization process retains important information. The system uses Flask as the development framework, which is a lightweight web server framework to handle user input, process the text and apply the algorithms from the python script. For the interface the proposed tool uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the summarized information. The below figure is a screenshot of the user interface of the summarizing tool (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8 Summarizing user interface (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHybrid Long Document Summarization using C2F-FAR and ChatGPT: A Practical Study \r\n\r\nLong Document summarization has drawn a lot of attention nowadays in the field of information retrieval. The development of cutting-edge language models like C2F-FAR and ChatGPT has created new opportunities for exploring the real-world uses of hybrid summarization pipelines. This paper gives significant research initiatives and advancements in lengthy document summarization and focuses on the advantages and difficulties of the hybrid approaches used in this paper.\r\n\r\nDue to the extensive amount of information and the need for consistency and integrity in the summaries, long documents have issues while summarizing because of large amount of information and the need of coherence summaries. Traditional extractive methods tend to struggle with generating coherent and concise summaries. Large language models like ChatGPT enable abstractive approaches addressing the challenges but also have problems with content hallucination and stylistic inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nC2F-FAR\r\n\r\nIn this paper, C2F-FAR (Content-to-flow Extractive Facilitated Abstractive summarization) was introduced that offers an extractive summarization approach for long documents. It relies on sentence extraction to identify key information, aiming to enhance the summaries. The study shows that C2F-FAR can generate summaries with competitive automated metrics, indicating its potential as a basis for hybrid summarization. It can automatically select sentences from a document by considering the semantics similarity between blocks of text and between different sentences. The below figure illustrates the application of default C2F-FAR settings to 20 cleaned articles, demonstrating that the number of blocks partitions generally increases with the number of sentences in an article which shows that the model can automatically capture semantic blocks in text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9 Testing C2F-FAR default settings on 20 articles (Lu, et al., 2023).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChatGPT\r\n\r\nThe research also focused on utilizing ChatGPT for summarization, specifically in the context of extractive summaries generated by C2F-FAR with a particular emphasis on long documents. The summarization process involved in the two-step prompting method generally yielded satisfactory summary length compared to human written summaries. However, repeated requests for additional details led to irrelevancy. These summarizations were performed based on GPT-3.5, except for the final test using GPT-4 for summarizing the entire book. \r\n\r\nEvaluation \r\n\r\nFor the evaluation, automated metrics such as ROGUE and BERT Score were used which suggested that machine-generated summaries are equivalent with the human written ones. The evaluation of summarization pipeline involved both human and automated metrics. Human evaluations reveal critical issues related to coherence, faithfulness, and style. The below figure shows the paraphrasing ability of ChatGPT against C2F-FAR extracted sentences using 20 cleaned articles. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10 Evaluation of article summarizes with various metrics (Lu, et al., 2023).\r\n\r\nIn the figure above, when ChatGPT paraphrases sentences extracted by C2F-FAR, it leads to slightly lower ROGUE-1 and BALANC scores, but a slightly higher BERT Score compared to C2F-FAR generated summaries. ROGUE-2 and ROGUE-L scores remain largely unchanged. However, paraphrasing introduces new words to convey the same meaning resulting in higher ESTIME alarms and lower ESTIME soft values compared to C2F-FAR generated summaries. Despite this, ChatGPT’s ESTIME alarms value remains lower than human written summaries and ESTIME soft value remains higher. In conclusion, ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to rewrite text to some extent while maintaining overall summary quality (Lu, et al., 2023).\r\n\r\nProject Methodology\r\n\r\nWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11 Work breakdown structure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware Development Methodology \r\n\r\nTo organize the software development cycle, Kanban Methodology will be used. Kanban is a method used to manage and optimize workflows in project management by emphasizing visual work, limiting work in progress, and promoting continuous improvement. Choosing Kanban for individual software development offers distinct advantages over other SDLC methodologies. Kanban allows high flexibility as it deals with prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency since solo developers often face quick change in priority. It encourages a constant flow of deliverables leading to quicker feedback. It allows individual developers to manage their work in a way that suits their own pace and style, as it does not have a predefined iteration like Scrum, allowing them not to spend time on detailed planning sessions or assigning tasks (Raut, 2015). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12 Glimpse to Trello\r\n\r\nTrello will be utilized to follow the Kanban method, utilizing its visual card-based system for effective task and project management. Trello was launched in 2011, attributed to user friendly design and adaptability which helped it in gaining popularity. In Trello, the tasks are visualized as cards or sticky notes on a visual board which is kanban and, usually divided into columns that represent different stages of the workflow, such as ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’ and ‘Done’. These cards are movable across the columns to reflect the progress of the work (Johnson, 2021). \r\n\r\nEvidence of Project Management\r\n\r\nProject Milestones Achieved \r\n\r\nThe project Document to Text Summarization using AI has made substantial progress in delivering a functional system. Since the whole project was divided into several systems, which includes User Management System, Document Management System, Summarization System, and Database System. It was easier to work on each functional system. The project initiated with the implementation of Kanban methodology using Trello proved to be a highly effective approach for managing this project. Trello provided me with the visual organization of the project, and with the help of automation, I was able to organize tasks, track progress and adapt to changing priorities seamlessly. \r\n\r\nSprint Planning\r\n\r\nInitial Phase\r\n\r\nThe project was initiated with the research and design phase. In the research phase, individual research, literature reviews, survey forms and reviewing other systems helped me picturize the system. With the initial requirement and research, I was able to design a basic wireframe and then give a brand theme and identity to my Lo-Fi design where I improved my wireframes and prepared Hi-Fi UI designs with a theme that followed the color, typography, and basic layout of the system. While surveying the system, I was able to gather the challenges and scenarios where this system can be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13 Sample survey 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14 Sample survey 2\r\n\r\nDevelopment Phase \r\n\r\nThe development phase was initiated with the use of GitHub from August 20, 2023, here I was able to work with the Django framework for the system development where with the assigned tasks in Trello for Sprint 1, related to User Management followed by the development on login, signup and logout were performed. Along with user management, Document Management System and Database Management System were successfully established. Here, authentication features for users, profile functionalities, uploading and storing documents were developed. The work on API based summarization was done from implementing the summarization in Notebook to integrating it to the system. At the end of Sprint 1, initiation of research and development on Summarization System was done. The progress on the development is demonstrated below with the help of GitHub insights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 15 Work insight in GitHub for contributions\r\n\r\nFor Sprint 2, major updates in the development done in Sprint 1 were performed where firstly, forgotten password authentication, popup modal, upgrading the frontend, use of messages and other tasks were performed. The issues in implementing API were concerned.\r\n\r\nTo track every task is going seamlessly as planned in the Gantt Chart, proper optimization and use of GitHub, Trello Board and Meeting Minutes were done. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 16 Commits track in GitHub\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent Technologies and Tools Used\r\n\r\nHTML/ CSS/ JS \r\n\r\nHTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for front-end development for this system, where HTML helps in structuring the content where CSS helps in defining the visual representation of the HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and attractive design. Similarly, JavaScript helps in adding interactivity, enabling dynamic content updates and enhancing the user engagement.\r\n\r\nDjango Framework \r\n\r\nDjango Framework was chosen for backend due to my familiarity with Python language. Django is known for its effectiveness in handling web applications. It is a free and open-source web framework for Python that accelerates the development of web applications. It offers a more effective method to build and develop web programs that initiating from scratch because it removes the need to build the backend, APIs, JavaScript (IBM, 2023). \r\n\r\nMariaDB \r\n\r\nTo store the data, MariaDB will be used due to its user-friendly interface simplifies database management, making it an excellent choice for an uncomplicated database solution. \r\n\r\nNLP Model \r\n\r\nNLP model is the proposed model that will be used for the machine learning aspect of the system. TextRank is one of the algorithms that extracts important sentences from a document. Similarly for the proposed system, transformer-based models such as BERT and BART could be used for abstractive summarization (Pietro, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtefact Designs\r\n\r\nLegend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUM-F-1.0\r\n\r\nSub systems\r\n\r\nUM	: User Management System\r\n\r\nDM	: Document Management System\r\n\r\nSM	: Summarization System\r\n\r\nDMS	: Database Management System\r\n\r\nNM	: Notification Management System\r\n\r\nTypes of Requirements\r\n\r\nF	: Functional Requirements\r\n\r\nNF	: Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\nUR	: Usability Requirements\r\n\r\nNumbering\r\n\r\nUM-F-1.0\r\n\r\nSub systems\r\n\r\nUM	: User Management System\r\n\r\nDM	: Document Management System\r\n\r\nSM	: Summarization System\r\n\r\nDMS	: Database Management System\r\n\r\nNM	: Notification Management System\r\n\r\nTypes of Requirements\r\n\r\nF	: Functional Requirements\r\n\r\nNF	: Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\nUR	: Usability Requirements\r\n\r\nNumbering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUser Management System (UM)\r\n\r\nSRS\r\n\r\nReq.

Here the project timeline is divided into six phases. The first phase is the phase of project initiation where the requirement gathering, research and proposal is prepared for the project. Based on the first phase the second phase starts with the basic visualization of the overall system through wireframing and creating the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of the system. After this, the phase of development kicks off with the integration of API in a crude system without a frontend. The evaluation of the API system will be conducted and then the NLP model will be developed which includes the preprocessing, model architecture design, model training, and fine tuning of the system. The model will then be displayed after the front-end development and the backend development will help in setting up the backend with database integration. Finally, a final documentation of the whole project will be done accordingly as shown in the Gantt Chart below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 34 Proposed Gantt Chart\r\n\r\nUpdated Gantt Chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 35 Final Gantt Chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAdhikari, S., M. & R., 2020.

Spacy\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThis article provides a general overview of the area of NLP-based automated text summarization.Figure 8 Summarizing user interface (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHybrid Long Document Summarization using C2F-FAR and ChatGPT: A Practical Study \r\n\r\nLong Document summarization has drawn a lot of attention nowadays in the field of information retrieval.Spacy in Text Summarization\r\n\r\nThe automatic text summarization with the above techniques faced challenges particularly with abstractive summarization.Implementation of NLP based on automatic text summarization using spacy\r\n\r\nSummarization of large texts has become a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP) and has garnered significant attention in both academic research and commercial applications.Extractive Summarization \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Extractive summarization involves choosing sentences directly from the source text to create a concise summarization.Abstractive Summarization\r\n\r\nAbstractive summarization is a method where the generated summary doesn’t necessarily consist of sentences present in the original text, instead it creates new sentences that capture the key concepts.Summarization Techniques\r\n\r\nAn unsupervised framework called SummCoder for extractive summarization was introduced that employs a scoring system, considering sentence content relevance, sentence novelty, and sentence position relevance, to select sentences for the summary.Database Management\r\n\r\nThe system will use MariaDB to manage data storage and will be storing user information, uploaded documents and generated summaries allowing the users to access and review the summaries of their uploaded documents whenever they need.Since the whole project was divided into several systems, which includes User Management System, Document Management System, Summarization System, and Database System.Evidence of

Social Impact  \r\nThe social impact of the Barber Appointment System is substantial, influencing both the \r\nservice providers and the customers.  \r\n1.1. Beneficial  Aspect  \r\nThe barber appointment system changes how customers feel when they visit. Instead of \r\nwaiting around, people can now pick the time they want to come in for a haircut. This \r\nmakes folks happy because they can plan when to visit and don\'t have to wait a long t ime. \r\nIt\'s like having control over their own schedule, which makes them feel good when they\'re \r\nat the barber shop. But it\'s not just good for customers. Barbers also benefit from this \r\nsystem. It helps them manage their time better, so they can focus more o n giving great \r\nhaircuts instead of worrying about too many people waiting. This makes customers even \r\nhappier because they get better service, and it might make them tell their friends about it \r\ntoo. \r\nThis system doesn\'t just fix waiting times; it makes things more reliable and professional. \r\nCustomers like knowing exactly when they\'ll get their haircut without any long waits. And \r\nfor barbers, it helps build their reputation as pros who care about being on time and \r\nmaking customers happy. When both customers and barbers feel good about the system, \r\nit makes the barber shop a nicer place for everyone. It\'s a win -win situation that helps the \r\nquality of service and how much customers enjoy their visit.  \r\n1.2. Detrimental  Aspect  \r\nIntroducing a system where you book your barber appointment can bring some good \r\nthings, but it also has downsides that might cause some problems. One big worry is that \r\nnot everyone might be able to use it. Some folks might not have computers or might not \r\nknow how to book online, which might make it hard for them to get a haircut when they \r\nwant. This could make a gap between people who can easily book online and those who \r\nprefer just showing up at the shop. For some, going in without an appointment is how th ey \r\nlike it or the only way they can get their haircut. Also, using this system a lot might change \r\nthe way barbers and customers talk and get along. Usually, when you just walk in for a \r\nhaircut, there\'s chatting and a friendly vibe between barbers and custo mers. But if most 2 \r\n \r\npeople start looking ahead, it might take away that casual and friendly feeling. The system \r\nhelps the barbers manage time better, but it might mean less of those fun, unplanned \r\nconversations that make the barber shop feel special.  \r\nAnother problem is that this system might not work well for people who come in without \r\nan appointment. If the schedule is always full, those who don’t book beforehand might \r\nhave to wait longer or might even get turned away. This could make them upset and l ess \r\nlikely to come back. Plus, the barber shop might lose money because they’re not helping \r\nthese customers as well as they could. It’s important to find a balance between the good \r\nthings the appointment system brings and making sure everyone can still eas ily get a \r\nhaircut. Keeping things flexible and allowing people to walk in without an appointment is \r\nimportant to keep the friendly vibe and make sure everyone feels welcome. Making sure \r\nthe system doesn’t take away from the special connections between barb ers and \r\ncustomers will help keep the barber shop a great place for everyone.  \r\n2. Ethical Issues  \r\nEthical concerns in the Barber Appointment System include the issue related to user \r\nprivacy, data security, and fair access to services.  \r\n2.1. Privacy Concerns  \r\nWhen you make an appointment at a barber shop, you share info like your name, phone \r\nnumber, and sometimes payment details. But there\'s a worry that this info might not be \r\nsafe if the system isn\'t secure enough. You might wonder what they do with your info,  like \r\nwhen you visit the barber shop. If they share it without asking, it can make you feel \r\nuneasy. It\'s important they keep your details safe and don’t use them without your \r\npermission. This is about keeping your personal info private and secure. It\'s sup er \r\nimportant that the barber shop does things the right way with your info. They should ask \r\nfor your permission before taking any details and be clear about how they\'ll use and \r\nprotect your info. It’s all about earning your trust and handling your info car efully.  \r\nIt’s not just about hackers trying to get your data; it’s also about how the barber shop itself \r\ntakes care of it. If they don’t follow the rules or aren’t careful enough, your private details \r\ncould end up where they shouldn’t be. This might lead to problem s like someone 3 \r\n \r\npretending to be you or getting ads you don\'t want. To stop these problems, the system \r\nneeds to be super safe from hackers. They should have clear rules about how they collect, \r\nstore, and use your data. And if you ever want them to get rid of your info, th ey should do \r\nit without any trouble. Making sure they handle your personal info the right way is crucial \r\nfor keeping your trust and keeping your private stuff safe.  \r\n2.2. Fair Access  \r\nMaking sure everyone can easily get a haircut is a big part of being fair with a barber \r\nappointment system. It\'s not just about keeping information safe; it\'s also about treating \r\neveryone equally and giving them the same chances to get a haircut. Some folk s like to \r\nplan and book their haircut time using computers or phones. But not everyone can do \r\nthat. Some people might not have these gadgets or might need a haircut right away \r\nbecause something unexpected happened. Being fair means making a system that wor ks \r\nfor both types of people,  those who plan and those who show up without an appointment. \r\nIt\'s like finding a way to make sure everyone, no matter how they like to book their haircut, \r\ncan still get it done when they need it.  \r\nThe goal is to make sure nobody feels left out. If the system only helps those who book \r\nahead, it might leave out folks who can\'t do that. So, it\'s important to have a system that\'s \r\nfriendly to both planned appointments and people who just walk in. This fa irness stops \r\nany unfair treatment in the barber shop. If the system only helps those who book ahead, \r\nit might not be fair to those who need to walk in without an appointment for different \r\nreasons. So, having a fair system means creating a place where every one feels welcome \r\nand gets the same chance to get a great haircut, no matter how they decide to book their \r\nappointments.  \r\n3. Legal Implications  \r\nThe legal landscape for the Barber Appointment System involves adherence to cyber \r\nlaws, such as GDPT, Equity Act, and copyright issues.  \r\n3.1. GDPR Compliance  \r\nThe GDPR is like a set of rules that tell companies how to handle your personal info. For \r\nthe barber system, it means they must be careful with your details. They can’t just take 4 \r\n \r\nyour info; they need your permission first. And when they use it, it\'s only for booking your \r\nhaircut, nothing else. It\'s like they must keep it safe and locked up, and they can’t let \r\nanyone else use it unless you say it\'s okay. If you want them to delete y our info, they must \r\ndo it. Following these rules ensures the system keeps your private info safe and respects \r\nyour wishes. Not following these rules is serious. They could get in trouble and face big \r\nfines. The rules are there to protect your info, like a shield making sure it stays safe and \r\nisn’t used in ways you didn’t agree to  (Zaeem & Barber, 2020) . \r\nGDPR keeps your privacy safe. When the barber system follows these rules, it shows \r\nthey care about your info. It’s important because your info should only be used the way \r\nyou want it to be. It\'s like putting a lock on your details to keep them safe and how  you \r\nwant them to be used.  \r\n3.2. Equity Act and Accessibility  \r\nFollowing the Equity Act for a barber appointment system means making it friendly for \r\neveryone, no matter what makes them different. It\'s like setting up the system so that \r\neveryone, including those with disabilities, can use it easily without any problems . This \r\nmight mean using special tools for those who can’t see well, like things that read the \r\nscreen out loud. Or for folks who find it hard to move their hands, making the buttons \r\nbigger or easier to use. Imagine someone who can\'t see well trying to book a haircut. The \r\nsystem should talk or read what’s on the screen so they understand and can book their \r\nhaircut without any trouble. And for someone who can\'t move their hands easily, they \r\nmight need buttons that are easier to touch or a simpler way to move a round the system.  \r\nNot everyone can use computers or phones to book appointments. Some people might \r\nwant to call or just walk in without an appointment. So, following the Equity Act means \r\nmaking sure the system isn’t only for tech -savvy folks. It\'s about making a fair system  that \r\nworks for everyone, so anyone in the community can easily book a haircut in their own \r\nway. When the system follows the Equity Act, it\'s like giving a big welcome to everyone, \r\nno matter what they\'re good at or how they use technology. It makes sure no body feels \r\nleft out or has trouble using the system. It’s all about being fair and making it easy for \r\neveryone to get the service they need  (Congressional Research Service, 2021) . 5 \r\n \r\n4. Security Aspects  \r\nSecurity is paramount in the Barber Appointment System, focusing on the protection of \r\npersonal data, encryption, and overall user wellbeing.  \r\n4.1. Personal Data Protection  \r\nProtecting personal information in a barber appointment system, like names and phone \r\nnumbers, is super important. It\'s like locking these details in a safe box so only trusted \r\nfolks can get to them. To do this, the system needs strong security to stop anyo ne \r\nsneaking in and taking this important info. There are strict rules for handling this info. The \r\nsystem must follow these rules on how it collects, stores, and uses data. People trust the \r\nsystem to keep their info private, so having tough protection is ke y. It\'s like making a \r\nstrong fort to keep this info safe and secret.  \r\nImagine giving you your phone number to book a haircut. You expect it to stay safe and \r\nnot be used without your say so. That\'s why top -notch security in the system is a must. \r\nIt’s all about taking care of your details and keeping them away from the wrong p eople. \r\nWithout strong safety, this info could be at risk from hackers. It\'s like leaving the door \r\nopen for someone to sneak in and take something important. This could lead to big \r\nproblems like someone stealing your identity or misusing your info.  \r\n4.2. Encryption  \r\nIn a barber appointment system, encryption is like turning your important info into a secret \r\ncode that only trusted people can understand. It\'s like locking your data in a special box \r\nwith a code that only the right folks have. This makes it hard for sneak y people or hackers \r\nto understand or use your info if they try to get it, keeping it safe.  \r\nUsing encryption is super important because it adds a strong layer of protection to your \r\npersonal details, almost like putting a super strong lock on a door. Even if someone tries \r\nto sneak in and take your info, they won\'t be able to understand it because it\'s in a secret \r\ncode. This helps stop cyber troubles or people trying to steal your info. Encryption is all \r\nabout keeping your personal info safe and secret in the system. It\'s like making a secret \r\ncode that only the trusted people can understand, so no o ne else can see your info or \r\ncause any online problems  (Bai, et al., 2020) . 6 \r\n \r\nReferences  \r\nBai, W., Pearson, M., Kelley, P. & Mazurek, M., 2020.

But as events increase, it\'s tough to manage all the details. Using papers and spreadsheets isn\'t enough anymore. So, we made a Smart College Event Management System using the internet. This system makes event planning easier, keeps data organized, and helps everyone work together better (Pansare, Patil, Patil, Patil, & Bhonde, 2023).\r\n\r\nProblem\r\n\r\nColleges use old-fashioned ways to manage events, which isn\'t very efficient. To solve this, we made the Smart College Event Management System. It\'s a website where all event information is kept in one place. It\'s like a central hub for everything related to events. Anyone can use it from anywhere (Pansare, Patil, Patil, Patil, & Bhonde, 2023).\r\n\r\nHow It Works\r\n\r\nOur system uses a special combination of technologies known as the MERN stack. It\'s like a powerful toolbox for making websites. MongoDB is used to store data, like event details. Express.js helps the back-end work, while React.js makes the front-end look nice and interactive. And Node.js runs everything smoothly (Pansare, Patil, Patil, Patil, & Bhonde, 2023).\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\nAdmins can create, edit, and delete events.\r\n\r\nThey can also manage volunteers and track attendance.\r\n\r\nUsers can see event info, register, and log in.\r\n\r\nEvent details, location, time, and fees are easy to find.\r\n\r\nUsers can even sign up to help at events.\r\n\r\nRegistration:\r\n\r\nBefore using the system, you need to sign up.\r\n\r\nThis process makes sure you\'re authorized to use it.\r\n\r\nAdministrators:\r\n\r\nAdmins have special powers to control events.\r\n\r\nThey can create, edit, and manage events easily.\r\n\r\nThey also oversee how events are going.\r\n\r\nUsers:\r\n\r\nRegular users can see event details and register.\r\n\r\nThey can also volunteer and track their attendance.\r\n\r\nTechnology\r\n\r\nWe used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging website. The MERN stack made everything work together smoothly (Pansare, Patil, Patil, Patil, & Bhonde, 2023).\r\n\r\nResults and Future Plans\r\n\r\nOur system makes event planning and management much simpler. It saves time and effort, making events run smoothly. We might even make mobile apps and connect with different devices in the future (Pansare, Patil, Patil, Patil, & Bhonde, 2023).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOur Smart College Event Management System is a big step forward in organizing college events. It uses modern web tools and the MERN stack to make things easy for everyone. It\'s not just about events – it also helps with attendance, volunteers, and sharing information. This system makes college events more organized, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone involved (Pansare, Patil, Patil, Patil, & Bhonde, 2023).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembership information system Using Node JS\r\n\r\nIn the world of organizing membership-related activities, making sure that we handle member data efficiently and accurately is super important. This involves managing and creating data about the people who are part of these memberships, organizing activity schedules, and dealing with their finances. In this study, we explore using Node.js, a computer language, to create a system that helps us manage all this membership information. To make sure our system is well-organized and does what it\'s supposed to do, we use a design method called the Unified Modeling Language (UML). What we found is that Node.js is good at creating systems for memberships. This system, overseen by an administrator, does a lot of things well. It collects and organizes data about members, manages their money, keeps track of what activities they\'re involved in, and handles any contributions they make. This system is super-efficient and keeps a detailed history of everything members do, like when they first sign up, when they make updates, when they log in, when they make financial transactions, donate money, and participate in activities. Based on our findings, we have some suggestions for making this membership management system even better. We recommend adding a notification feature to help people access the information they need more easily. It would also be a good idea to create a version of the system that works well on mobile devices. In summary, the important terms related to this study are Membership System, Information System, Node.js, and Adonis.js (Sihotang, et al., 2019)..\r\n\r\nTechnology has been advancing fast, and this has led to a lot of research to find flexible solutions for different kinds of business processes in many industries. One area where technology plays a big role is in web services that give people information in an easy-to-use way. Information systems are a big part of managing everyday business transactions, helping with day-to-day operations, and giving important reports to people outside the organization. One specific use of information systems is in managing memberships. These systems help with things like signing up new members, handling their money, keeping track of what they do, and managing contributions and donations. Web-based systems are crucial because they help process data quickly and accurately, making work more efficient. In this research, we followed a structured approach called the Waterfall method. It\'s a systematic and step-by-step way of developing software. It\'s been around for a long time and is widely used in software engineering, even though some people say it\'s old-fashioned. The key idea is that each step must be completed before moving on to the next one, like a waterfall flowing down. We also used a method called Business Process Engineering to redesign existing business processes to match what our system needs. These processes include things like signing up new members, activating their accounts, managing their money, handling refunds, dealing with donations, and managing contacts (Sihotang, et al., 2019).\r\n\r\nTo build our system, we needed the right tools. We used a computer with Windows 10, a local database server called MariaDB, a text editor called Visual Studio Code, and Node.js as the main programming language. We also used Adonis.js, which is built on Node.js, to make our system even better.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Waterfall method, we successfully created a web-based membership information system using Node.js. We divided our research findings into two parts: the design of the system and how well it worked, which we tested and evaluated. In summary, this research explores how to make a membership information system using Node.js and a structured approach. The system efficiently manages member data, financial records, activities, and contributions, and there\'s potential to make it even better with features like notifications and a mobile version (Sihotang, et al., 2019).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExploring user acceptance of medical e-appointment systems for mental healthcare: A systematic literature review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study explores how people use online systems to make doctor appointments for mental health services. These systems promise to make scheduling appointments easier and more efficient. However, not much research has been done on whether people like and use these systems, especially in Morocco. We analyzed 11 studies conducted between 2012 and 2023 that used technology acceptance models. The most common models used were the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Continuance Intention of Use Model. We found 35 factors that influence whether people accept and use these systems, including how good the system is, how easy it is to use, and how much they trust it. Interestingly, there\'s very little research on this topic in African mental healthcare, which is something that future studies should explore.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nTechnology is changing the way we access healthcare, including making appointments with doctors online. These online systems, called Medical E-Appointment Systems (MEAS), are supposed to make it easier for people to see their mental health providers. They can help reduce the time people spend waiting for appointments and reduce the chances of missing them. However, not many studies have looked at whether people like using these systems, especially in Morocco. Most studies focus on how well these systems work and how they affect healthcare services. This review aims to fill this gap by examining 11 studies published between 2012 and 2023 that use technology acceptance models to understand MEAS use (Khalil & Serhier, 2023)..\r\n\r\nArticle Mapping\r\n\r\nIn this review, we will talk about the models and theories that researchers use to study how people use MEAS. We\'ll also look at the factors that influence whether someone likes and uses these systems. We\'ll discuss where these studies were done, who the participants were, and what the studies found. Finally, we\'ll suggest areas for future research.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nTo find the studies we reviewed, we followed specific guidelines and searched for articles from November 2022 to April 2023. We used four databases: Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar. We used keywords like "Technology Adoption," "Healthcare," "Mental Health," "E-Appointment System," and others. We only looked at studies published between 2012 and 2023 that used technology adoption models to study MEAS use.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nWe started with 805 studies in our search but narrowed it down to 11 studies after removing duplicates and checking titles and abstracts.\r\n\r\nPrevailing Technology Adoption Models and Theories\r\n\r\nWe found two main categories of models used to understand MEAS use. The first one is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and its variations, used in four studies. The second category is post-technology adoption models, used in three studies. Some studies combined TAM with other theories like trust theory and innovation diffusion theory. One study used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and its variations.\r\n\r\nDeterminants of MEAS Acceptance\r\n\r\nIn our review, we found 35 factors that influence whether someone accepts and uses MEAS. One common factor is "behavioral intention," which means whether someone plans to use MEAS. Many studies looked at TAM factors like how easy it is to use (perceived ease of use) and how useful it is (perceived usefulness). Other factors include service quality, satisfaction, user experience, relationship quality, and system quality. Some factors were specific to the context of the study and not part of any existing technology acceptance theory.\r\n\r\nDeployment of MEAS\r\n\r\nMost of the studies we reviewed focused on general medical services, not just mental healthcare. Only one study looked at MEAS for blood donation, and another studied MEAS in nutrition.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nOur review helps us understand how people use MEAS for mental healthcare. Most studies extended the TAM model to see if people intend to use or continue using MEAS. We suggest that future research should explore different models, like the theory of health beliefs. "Behavioral intention" emerged as an important factor in MEAS use, like other research in healthcare. TAM factors like perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were crucial in deciding whether people accept MEAS. Other factors like satisfaction, trust, and user experience also influenced people\'s intentions to use MEAS (Khalil & Serhier, 2023).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nOur review found a gap in research about MEAS use in African mental healthcare, particularly from the perspective of healthcare providers. TAM and its variations, along with the Continuance Intention of Use Model, are the most used models to study MEAS use. We identified 35 factors that influence MEAS acceptance, including internal factors related to users\' beliefs and perceptions. These factors play a big role in how people use MEAS. Key factors include the quality of the healthcare service, the quality of the system, effective communication, perceived usefulness, ease of use, satisfaction, and trust. This study gives valuable insights into technology acceptance in healthcare and suggests areas for future research in mental healthcare settings (Khalil & Serhier, 2023).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproving Healthcare with Online Doctor Appointments: A Case Study of Nkozi Hospital\r\n\r\nThis study conducted at Nkozi Hospital shows how using computers to manage hospital information can help with the challenges of a growing population. Before, they used a manual system, which caused problems like losing data and people getting access to information they shouldn\'t. To fix these issues, they made an Online Doctor Appointment System. They collected data using surveys, interviews, and watching how things work. They used a program called SPSS to analyze the data and put it in tables and charts. They built the system using a database called MySQL and a program called Dreamweaver. They also tested it before using it for real. The study suggests keeping the system up to date and training staff to use it better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThis part talks about how Nkozi Hospital started using an online system to book doctor appointments instead of the old manual way. It says that using technology like this is important, especially in Africa where more and more people are using technology. The study aims to fix problems with the old system, like patients waiting a long time and staff having too much work. It also mentions that having an online system is important during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe study has three main goals: to learn from what others have done before, to design the new system, and to test it. They want to find out what problems the old system had, how to make the new one, and how to check if it works. The study only looks at Nkozi Hospital, and its goal is to make things faster and better for patients. This study is important because it can help make healthcare better, guide decisions, and teach others about healthcare, technology, and how they affect society (Davis & Kabega, 2023)..\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n\r\nIn this part, the researcher talks about how they collected information for the online doctor appointment system study. They used two kinds of methods: numbers and words. Numbers helped them see the big picture, and words helped them understand the details. They talked to different people like doctors, patients, and nurses to make sure they got a good mix of opinions.\r\n\r\nTo collect data, they used surveys, interviews, watching what happened, and looking at records. Surveys are like questionnaires, where people answer questions on paper or online. Interviews are when you talk to someone and ask them questions to get more information. Watching what happened is when you quietly watch people and write down what they do. Looking at records is when you read documents to learn more.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting data, they looked at it with a computer program called SPSS. This program changed the data into percentages and put it in tables and charts. This helped them see what was wrong with the old system and how to make it better.\r\n\r\nOverall, this part explains how they gathered and studied the information for the online doctor appointment system study (Davis & Kabega, 2023)..\r\n\r\nTools and Technology\r\n\r\nTo make the online system, they needed a good computer with a special database program and some other tools. They used a web browser and PHP to talk to the database. They also used things like SQL server, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Dreamweaver, and Windows. All these things worked together to make sure everything ran smoothly.\r\n\r\nTesting and Implementation\r\n\r\nBefore the online system was ready to use, they needed to make sure it worked correctly. They tested it on different types of computers, like Windows and Linux. They checked each part of the system by itself to make sure it worked right. Then, they put all the parts together and tested how they worked together.\r\n\r\nAfter the testing, they started using the system for real. This included installing it, changing from the old system to the new one, teaching people how to use it, and making it available for everyone to use.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe new online doctor appointment system at Nkozi Hospital will make healthcare better by improving the way things are done. In the past, they did a lot of things by hand, which made treatment slower and less effective. But now, with the new system, things will be faster and smoother. It will help more patients get the care they need without long waits and hassles. In summary, the new system will modernize and improve healthcare at Nkozi Hospital, and it fits with the trend of using technology to make healthcare better (Davis & Kabega, 2023).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreating a Better Appointment System for Schools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore and more people are using the internet to book appointments these days. Businesses are using online systems to make scheduling easier. This paper talks about making a special online system just for schools, especially for students and their teachers. This system is designed to make appointment scheduling automatic, reduce mistakes, and make things run more smoothly. We explained how we made this system and checked if it works well. We also talked about the technology we used and the important design choices we made (Qaffas & Barker, 2012)..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n\r\nWe all use web applications every day, like apps on our phones or websites on our computers. These apps have made many tasks much easier. One area where web apps can be helpful is in scheduling appointments, especially in schools. In the past, schools used manual methods for scheduling appointments, which often led to problems like double bookings or missed appointments. This paper is about creating an online appointment system to solve these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of our system is to make it easy for students to book appointments with their teachers. It works in real-time, meaning appointments are scheduled instantly without errors. It\'s available 24/7, making it convenient for both students and teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n\r\nTo build the system, we designed a user-friendly interface and added features that students and teachers need. We carefully thought about the data the system would use and created the system\'s structure accordingly. The main functions of the system include user registration, managing student projects, scheduling appointments, confirming appointments, and canceling appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting and Implementation\r\n\r\nWe tested the system thoroughly to make sure it works correctly and is reliable. This testing included checking how users navigate the system, registering as a user, managing student projects, scheduling appointments, receiving email notifications, and managing user access. The system\'s ability to send email reminders for appointments was an important feature we checked. We also gathered feedback from users to understand what they found important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults and Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe conducted a survey with 28 students to get their feedback on the system. Most of them were studying for a master\'s degree. The survey showed that students found the system useful, especially the ability to join projects with teachers and the importance of email reminders for appointments. The system we developed has the potential to make appointment scheduling in schools much more efficient and accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn summary, using web-based appointment systems in schools can modernize and simplify appointment processes, benefiting both students and teachers. This paper contributes to the growing field of web applications and their role in making administrative tasks in education easier (Qaffas & Barker, 2012).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nDavis, M. & Kabega, 2023.

The detection of anomalies in digestive endoscopy \r\nplays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. In this \r\nproject, I have developed a system capable of identifying diseases using a Convolutional \r\nNeural Network (CNN) wi th an F1 score of 0.95 and generating localization of detected \r\nanomalies using Gradient -weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad -CAM). The p ublicly \r\navailable Hyper -Kvasir dataset was used to finetune a Residual Network (ResNet) model \r\nfor multi -class classif ication.  The heatmap was generated using a weighted sum of \r\ngradients of feature maps with respect to the predicted classification. The heatmap \r\nprovides e xplainability  and adds transparency to the model. After conducting experiments, \r\nI found that the qualit y of the heatmap generated depends on the amount of fully \r\nconnected layers with fewer  layers producing heatmaps with higher confidence (focused \r\nlocalization).   \r\n   \r\nTable of Contents  \r\n1.

Introduction  \r\n1.1. Project Briefing  \r\n1.1.1 Project Introduction  \r\nIn this revolutionary age of technology, the amount of data produced daily has increased \r\nexponentially. Machine Learning concepts can be used to leverage the power of these \r\nraw data. Compute r vision is a field of machine learning which allows computers to \r\nprocess visual data to produce a meaningful output. The use of computer vision has been \r\nemployed in tasks like disease detection (Ouhami, 2021) , self -driving car s (Janai, et al., \r\n2020) , sports (Thomas, et al., 2017) , and so on. With the growing use of machine learning \r\nin every field possible, it only makes sense to harness its power in the field of medical \r\nscience.  \r\nThis project focuses on the use of computer vision in the field of digestive capsule \r\nendoscopy. Capsule -endoscopy is a medical procedure where the patient swallows a \r\nwireless camera which after passing through their entire digestive tract provides v isual \r\ninformation about their gastrointestinal tract. Each frame of the video is then manually \r\nanalyzed by endoscopists to detect any anomalies in the digestive tract (Hwang, et al., \r\n2021) . This process tends to be cumbersome an d requires high attention. With the help \r\nof a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the detection process can be automated. First, \r\nthe CNN model is trained on the publicly available dataset with augmentation, and after \r\nit has achieved a good validation accur acy, it can be deployed in a web service to be \r\nused by doctors.  \r\n \r\n1.1.2. Problem Statement  \r\nThe analysis of endoscopy videos is a time -consuming and tedious process for \r\nendoscopists. They need to check every frame of the video with great precision to check \r\nfor the presen ce of different kind s of anomalies such as ulcers, bleeding, inflammation, \r\nand tumors. The videos can be very long which makes  the process of reviewing the videos \r\ntake several hours or even days.  This long process of evaluation of videos can c ause \r\nstress to the endoscopists resulting in improper diagnosis which may even lead to fatality. 2 | P a g e  \r\n The slow diagnosis can also be anxiety -inducing to the patients themselves  (Kugler, \r\n2022) . \r\n1.1.3. The Project as a Solution  \r\nThis project aims to automate the tedious process of analyzing the output video of \r\ndigestive endoscopy. Machine learning can be used to train a computer to be able to \r\nrecognize diseases in an image. This machine -learning model can then be deployed  \r\nonline to be used by endoscopists and researchers alike. The web application will be able \r\nto take in an image or a video, process it, and provide information about the input data. \r\nThis automated pipeline will make the process of detecting anomalies in dig estive \r\nendoscopy more streamlined.  \r\nFaster  diagnosis can also help alleviate stress for both endoscopists and patients alike. \r\nThe localization of diseases in the endoscopic images can be helpful to beginner \r\nendoscopists by aiding in their diagnosis.  \r\n1.1.4. Aspects of AI  \r\nComputer Vision  \r\nComputer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to \r\ninterpret and understand visual data from the world around them. It involves the use of \r\nalgorithms and mathematical models to analyze and extract information from images and \r\nvideos. Computer vision has applications in various industries, including healthcare, \r\nautomotive, and security, and is becoming increasingly important in areas such as \r\nrobotics and autonomous systems. Some of the key  techniques used in computer vision \r\ninclude image processing, object recognition, and machine learning. One of the most \r\npowerful tools in computer vision is the convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of \r\ndeep learning algorithm that is designed to recog nize patterns and features within images.  \r\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  \r\nConvolutional Neural Network is a type of machine learning technique that extracts high -\r\nlevel spatial features from an image by convolving a kernel/filter through an image. The \r\nextracted feature is then fed to a Multi -layered Perceptron (MLP) to find a com plex relation 3 | P a g e  \r\n between those features and provided classes.\r\n \r\nFigure 1: Convolutional Neural Network  (Saha, 2022)  \r\nA CNN model usually consists of a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a fully \r\nconnec ted layer . \r\n \r\n1. Convolutional Layer : It is the main component of a CNN. In a convolutional layer, \r\na filter (square matrix with learnable parameters) is slid through the entire  \r\ninput image to form a high -level feature that preserves spatial information. \r\n \r\nFigure 2: Convolutional Operation (European Space Agency, 2022)  \r\n2. Pooling Layer : A pooling layer is used to reduce the dimens ions of the extracted \r\nfeatures. It down -samples the feature matrix while preserving information. Usually, \r\ntwo types of pooling are employed: average pooling and max pooling. Average \r\n4 | P a g e  \r\n pooling outputs the average of data points over the kernel size whereas ma x \r\npolling returns the largest value among the kernels.  \r\n \r\n3. Fully Connected Layer : This part of the CNN consists of most of the learnable \r\nparameters of the network. It is a connection of a dense layer that usually collapses \r\ninto a SoftMax layer at the end. Th e SoftMax layer outputs the probability that an \r\nitem belongs to a specific class. The output of the convolutional layers is flattened \r\nand fed to this connection of dense layers.  \r\n \r\n1.2. Aims  \r\nTo detect diseases in the digestive tract automatically  and provide  its localizations . \r\nUsing labeled data, computer -vision models such as CNN can be developed to find \r\npatterns in the data to be able to recognize different types of diseases. This capability of \r\nCNNs can be used to automatically detect diseases in the digest ive tract with out the need \r\nfor human intervention. This allows for fast diagnosis resulting in faster treatment which \r\nin most case s is a matter of life and death  (Aljarad & Mobayed, 2021) . GradCAM is the \r\nmethod of representation of learned weights from the filters of a convolutional model in \r\nthe input image (Selvaraju, et al., 2017) . Grad -CAM is used to represent how a CNN \r\nmodel makes its decision. This localizat ion provided by Grad -CAM can be used to find \r\nnew ways of identifying diseases. The u se of Grad -CAM makes the more transparent and \r\ntrustworthy.  \r\n1.3. Objectives  \r\n1. To create a model which takes in image s or video of digestive endoscopy and provides \r\nan accurate classification of diseases.  \r\n2. To create a model capable of visualizing localizations of detected diseases  \r\n3. To streamline the diagnostic process of Capsule Digestive Endoscopy resulting in \r\nfaster treatment and recovery.  5 | P a g e  \r\n 4. To design and develop a web-based application that can be used by endoscopists to \r\nautomatically detect diseases.  \r\n \r\n1.4. Artefacts  \r\n1.4.1. Functional Decomposition Diagram (FDD)  \r\n \r\nFigure 3: Functional Decomposition Diagram  \r\n1.4.2. System Design  \r\nThe system has  been divided into four sub -systems  with each having its responsibility. \r\nThe systems are briefly explained below:  \r\nUser Interaction System  \r\nA user interaction system is a fundamental part of any modern software application or \r\nsystem. It is essentially the front -end interface that enables users to interact with the \r\nsystem, input data, and retrieve results . In this context, a user interaction system is a \r\nweb-based interface that allows doctors to input patient information and endoscopic \r\ndata. This data is then passed on to other subsystems within the larger system that will \r\nanalyze and process the data to generate meaningful results. Once the analysis is \r\ncomplete, the results are displayed back to the doctor via the same web interface.  This \r\ninterface can also be used by doctors to view past records and results of patients.  \r\n6 | P a g e  \r\n Data Preprocessing Network  \r\nMachine Learning models are constrained by the fact that they can only take data in the \r\nformat that they have been trained on. This sub -system is re sponsible for converting all \r\ndata sent by the user to the format that can be used by the machine learning model. The \r\nfirst take of this network is to convert video data into images. The images are then resized \r\nto pixel values corresponding to the model’s i nput size. The pixel value s are the n \r\nnormalized and converted to a special datatype called Tensors.  \r\nImage Classification Network  \r\nThe Image Classification Network is a crucial subsystem of the user interaction system, \r\nresponsible for analyzing and classifyi ng the images generated from the endoscopic data \r\nprovided by the doctors. It is the heart of the system, as it plays a vital role in generating \r\nmeaningful results that can aid doctors in diagnosing and treating their patients. In \r\nessence, the Image Classif ication Network is a Machine Learning model that has been \r\ntrained on a vast dataset of endoscopic images. The model learns to identify and classify \r\nspecific features within the images that are indicative of certain conditions or diseases.  \r\nImage Localizati on Network  \r\nThe Image Localization Network is a complimentary part of the Image Classification \r\nNetwork as it takes data output by that sub -system. This system is used to identify and \r\nlocate specific areas of interest within an image. In this case, this netw ork will locate \r\nregions in the endoscopic images responsible for the classification.  \r\nStorage and Data Management  \r\nStorage and Data Management is responsible  for handling all processes  related to storing \r\nand retrieving data from databases . All data coming f rom the User  Interaction System \r\nshould be saved in the database and after classification and localization ha ve been \r\ncompleted, this system is responsible for providing data related to the results. This system  \r\nis also responsible for converting all image an d video datatype to URL format while \r\nsending a response using an API.  7 | P a g e  \r\n 1.5. Academic Questions  \r\n1. Can the process of diagnosis of diseases in digestive endoscopy be automated with \r\nhigh accuracy and speed?  \r\n2. Can the automatic diagnosis provided be explained further using localized heatmaps?  \r\n1.6. Scopes  \r\n1. This application can be used by endoscopists in hospitals for fast and streamlined \r\nprocessing of digestive endoscopy data to detect anomalies.  \r\n2. It can also be used by researchers to compare their model s for accuracy evaluation.  \r\n1.7. Limitations  \r\n1. Less availability of data hampers the model\'s accuracy because of its inability to \r\ngeneralize to all kinds of data.  \r\n2. Literature Review  \r\n2.1. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition  \r\nImage recognition tasks are often handled by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). \r\nCNN models can generate features from an image and make predictions using those \r\nfeatures. The ongoing trend in image classification was to create deeper networks for \r\nharder tasks. But this trend suffered from the complication of vanishing/exploding \r\ngradients. When the gradients are passed backward during backpropagation, gradients \r\nwith values less than 1 get vanished and gradients with values more than 0 explode. To \r\nsolve thi s issue, the authors of this paper introduce the concept of skip connections (He, 8 | P a g e  \r\n et al., 2016) , which allows information to bypass one or more layers directly. \r\n \r\nFigure 4: Skip Connection (He, et al., 2016)  \r\nThis skip connection makes the deeper model more immune to the problem of \r\nvanishing/exploding gradients. Because of the skip connection, the deeper layers are at \r\nleast able to learn the identity to maintain the same accur acy with the same model having \r\nlesser layers  (He, et al., 2016) . Because of the skip connection, the model is able to learn \r\nmore than the identity when needed. To evaluate the advantage of skip connections in \r\ndeeper networks, t he ImageNet dataset, which contains 1.4 million photos of 10,000 \r\nclasses , was first used to train the model . The d ataset containing images of different sizes \r\nwas randomly cropped into 224x224 pixels with color augmentation. After each \r\nconvolutional layer, Batch Normalization (BN) was applied for faster convergence and to \r\nprevent overfitting. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used for learning  in the model \r\nand the learning rate was gradually reduced over the course of 600,000 iterations. The \r\nmini-batch s ize was set to 256.  \r\n9 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 5: Evaluation of ResNet models with other models (He, et al., 2016)  \r\nDifferent ResNet (Residual Networks) models were trained with a different number of \r\nlayers. The B and C i n the table above indicate a different type of skip connection. As \r\nevident from the table above, the ResNet model with 34 layers performs significantly \r\nbetter than both the VGGNet with 41 layers and GoogleNet with 44 layers. The top -5 \r\nerrors also drop for the ResNet models with the increase in layers which was not the case \r\nfor other networks.  \r\nFindings  \r\nAs the classification task at hand gets more complex, it is important to generate many \r\nhigh-level features from that image using deeper convolutions. Deeper networks suffer \r\nfrom the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients which can be solved using skip \r\nconnections. This fluidity provided by ResNet models allows us to develop very deep \r\nnetworks that can generate high -quality features requi red for the classification task.  \r\n2.2. Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization  \r\nConvolutional Neural Networks have been shrouded by the fact that the decision behind \r\ntheir prediction is often a mystery. (Zhou, et al., 2016)  aims to solve this issue by \r\ngenerating a localization map for the input image which is responsible for making the \r\nprediction. This process has been described as Class Activation Mapping (CAM).  \r\n10 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 6: Class Activation Mapping (Zhou, et al., 2016)  \r\nCNN models usually consist of two parts: convolutional layers and a fully connected layer. \r\nThe convolutional part of the model is responsible for generat ing features and the fully \r\nconnected layer is responsible for learning a complex relation between those features \r\nand labels. The complex relationship generated by the fully connected layer hides the \r\nreasoning behind the generation of those features. CAM re moves the use of fully \r\nconnected layers. Instead, it uses Global Average Pooling (GAP) (Lin, et al., 2013)  for \r\neach of the feature maps generated by the convolutional layer and multiplies it by a \r\nlearnable weight. The score gener ated is passed through a SoftMax layer to generate \r\npredictions. For an image, let 𝑓𝑘(𝑥,𝑦) be the output of an activation function of unit k in \r\nthe last convolution layer at the spatial region (𝑥,𝑦). The resulting output of GAP, 𝐹𝑘 is \r\n∑𝑓𝑘(𝑥,𝑦)𝑥,𝑦 . The input to the SoftMax for class c is 𝑆𝑐=∑𝑤𝑘𝑐\r\n𝑘𝐹𝑘 where 𝑤𝑘𝑐 is the weight \r\ncorresponding to class c for unit k. The output of the SoftMax for class c is given by,  \r\n𝑃𝑐=exp(Sc)\r\n∑exp(Sc)c \r\nBy replacing the value of 𝐹𝑘 into the class score 𝑆𝑐, we get  \r\n𝑆𝑐=∑𝑤𝑘𝑐∑𝑓𝑘(𝑥,𝑦)\r\n𝑥,𝑦 𝑘=∑∑kwkc\r\nx,yfk(x,y) \r\n11 | P a g e  \r\n The class activation map for class c, denoted as 𝑀𝑐, is a spatial representation where \r\neach element is determined by \r\n𝑀𝑐(𝑥,𝑦)=∑𝑤𝑘𝑐\r\n𝑘𝑓𝑘(𝑥,𝑦) \r\n(Zhou, et al., 2016)  \r\nThe process of up-sampling allows for the identification of image regions that are \r\nresponsible for the prediction by scaling the mapping back up to the size of the original \r\nimage.  \r\nGAP is prioritized over Global Max Pooling (GMP) because the authors believe that GAP \r\nfocus es on the entire spatial region whereas GMP focuses on only one part of the spatial \r\nregion. The generalization of GAP helps to generate a better mapping. Three prominent \r\nnetworks; AlexNet, VGGNet, and GoogLeNet were used for the evaluation of the \r\nalgorithm . For each network, the fully connected layers were replaced with a GAP \r\nfollowed by a SoftMax layer. Alongside removing the fully connected layers, a \r\nconvolutional layer of size 3 x 3, stride 1, and pad 1 with 1024 units w ere added. ImageNet \r\ndataset was us ed to train the model.  \r\nThe same error metric (top -1, top -5) were used for classification evaluation like in ILSVRC. \r\nThere was not much significant drop in performance regardless of removing millions of \r\nparameters (from the fully connected layer). There was  only a difference of 1 -2% \r\nclassification accuracy while using CAM. It is necessary for models to have good \r\nclassification accuracy to obtain a good class activation mapping.  12 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 7: Classification Error of CNN models with CAM (Zhou, et al., 2016)  \r\nA bounding box was generated around the localization using simple thresholding in order \r\nto evaluate its accuracy . The GoogLeNet -GAP achieved the lowest localization error of \r\n43% on top -5 which is a very goo d result considering that the model was not trained on \r\na single annotated image.  \r\n \r\nFigure 8: Localization Error of CNN models with CAM (Zhou, et al., 2016)  \r\n  \r\nFindings  \r\nThis paper presents a way of visualizing the reasoning behind the prediction of a CNN \r\nmodel using CAM. CAM can be used to generate accurate representations of the \r\nlocalizations without the need for annotated data. This trait is especially useful in the fie ld \r\nof medical AI where annotated data is less available. In the case of endoscopy, annotating \r\n13 | P a g e  \r\n data is very tedious so this advantage of CAM can be leveraged to generate localizations \r\nof diseases.  \r\n \r\n2.3. Grad -CAM: Why did you say that?  \r\nCNN models are often presented as a black box because the decision behind their \r\nprediction is not well known. Although it is known that the initial layers of CNN models \r\nextract low -level features like edges and shapes, the deeper layer extracts very complex \r\nhigh-level features  not comprehendible by us. Gradient Based Class Activation Mapping \r\n(Grad -CAM) localizes the area responsible for making that decision  (Selvaraju, et al., \r\n2017) . Grad -CAM adds to the idea of Class Activation Mapping (CAM).  \r\n \r\nFigure 9: Guided Grad -CAM (Selvaraju, et al., 2017)  \r\nTo generate the Grad -CAM visualization, the following steps are taken:  \r\n1. Forward pass: The input image is passed through CNN , and the output prediction \r\nis obtained. For this example, let\'s say CNN predicts that the image is a cat.  \r\n2. Backward pass: The gradients of the final fully connected layer with respect to the \r\npredicted clas s (cat) are calculated using backpropagation. These gradients represent \r\nthe importance of each node in the final fully connected layer for the prediction.  \r\n14 | P a g e  \r\n 3. Weighted sum: The gradients from step 2 are used to weight the activations of the \r\nfinal convolutional  layer. This is done by multiplying the gradients by the activations and \r\nsumming over the two nodes in the final fully connected layer. The resulting weighted \r\nactivations are a single value for each channel in the final convolutional layer.  \r\n4. Upsampling : The  weighted activations from step 3 are up-sampled  to the original \r\nresolution of the input image.  \r\n5. Overlay: The up -sampled activations from step 4 are overlaid . \r\nFindings  \r\nLike CAM, Grad -CAM can be used in the field of analyzing medical imagery because of \r\nits ability to localize entities without the need for annotated data. It offers greater flexibility \r\nand applicability compared to CAM, as it can be used with any CNN architecture and \r\ndoes not require any modifications to the network or training process. Grad -CAM also \r\nprovides a more direct and intuitive explanation of the network\'s decision -making process, \r\nas it uses the gradients of the final convolutional layer with respect to the predicted class \r\nto weigh the activations.  \r\n \r\n2.4. Improved classification and loca lization approach to small bowel \r\ncapsule endoscopy using convolutional neural network  \r\nThis journal article  (Hwang, et al., 2021)  has worked on a similar problem of detecting \r\nanomalies in pictures of digestive endoscopy. The mai n task at hand for this literature \r\nwas to classify images into three categories: Negative, Hemorrhagic, and Ulcerative. The \r\ndataset was extracted from 526 Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy videos from a hospital \r\nwhich was manually labeled by expert endoscopist s. The final dataset contained about \r\n30,000 images after augmentation.  15 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 10: The m odel architecture of (Hwang, et al., 2021)  \r\nThe architecture proposed by this paper is a modification of a VGGNet. The network \r\nconsisted of 14 convolutional layers, followed by a max pooling layer after each two \r\nconvolutional layers. The modifications can be seen in section (a) of the image above. \r\nThe working of Grad -CAM can be seen in section (b). A total of t hree models were trained \r\nin this paper:  \r\n \r\n1. Combined Model:  \r\n16 | P a g e  \r\n Two binary classification models were trained separately, and the results were \r\ncombined to create this model.  \r\na. NH Model: Responsible for only classifying Hemorrhagic images and Negative \r\nimages.  \r\nb. NU Mod el: Responsible for only classifying Ulcerative images and Negative \r\nimages.  \r\n2. Binary Model: This model was trained to detect whether  the image contained any \r\nkind of anomalies (either Hemorrhagic or Ulcerative) or not.  \r\nThese two models were evaluated on metri cs such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, \r\nNegative Predictive Value (NPV), and Positive Predictive Value (PPV). Both models were \r\nable to achieve good results in all the metrics.  \r\n \r\nFigure 11: Evaluation of Combined and Binary model of (Hwang, et al., 2021)  \r\n \r\nFindings  \r\nThis paper has proposed a new architecture for multi -class classification models. In the \r\ncase of anomalies in digestive endoscopy, there can be differe nt types of anomalies. \r\nThose anomalies can be further grouped  into specific categories (Hemorrhagic and \r\nUlcerative in this case). This grouping helps the model achieve a better score in the case \r\nof fewer data. The problem of few data can also be solved usi ng data augmentation as \r\ndone in the paper. The main takeaway of this paper can be to experiment with the use of \r\nan ensemble of single -class classification models instead of a multi -class classification \r\nmodel.  \r\n17 | P a g e  \r\n 2.5. Detecting early gastric cancer: Comparison  between the diagnostic \r\nability of convolutional neural networks and endoscopists  \r\nGlobally, gastric cancer ranks fourth among men\'s cancers and seventh among women\'s \r\ncancers, respectively.  Early diagnosis of gastric cancer can prevent death. The authors \r\nof this article compare the predictability power of an AI to the diagnosis capability of \r\nendoscopists. 13,000 images of endoscopy were collected from standard endoscopes \r\nand standard endoscopic video systems. A deep learning architecture, Single Shot \r\nMultiBo x Detector (SSD) was used to train the model  (Ikenoyama, et al., 2021) . The deep \r\nCNN models consisted of 16 layers and were built using the Caffe framework. SGD with \r\na fixed learning rate of 0.0001 was used to train the model. The model was evaluated \r\nusing similar evaluation metrics as mentioned in the paper above. To compare the \r\ndiagnosis prowess of the AI model, a total of 67 endoscopists were divided into two \r\ngroups: certified and non -certified. The inference was of th e CNN model was significantly \r\nhigher than the endoscopists. The sensitivity of the model was also very high as \r\ncompared to results by endoscopists. PPV and Specificity scores on the other hand seem \r\nto be lagging on the AI side.  \r\n \r\n 18 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 12: Comparison of CNN model with endoscopists (Ikenoyama, et al., 2021)  \r\nFindings  \r\nEndoscopy images are very difficult to diagnose on an image -by-image basis. Even \r\nthough endoscopists with greater training and experience can perform better than AI \r\nmodels, the use of AI in digestive endoscopy seems inevitable. CNN models can be used \r\nto aid lower -level endoscopists in making their diagnoses. The AI model in this case has \r\nhigher sensitivity, which means it can correctly class ify more anomalies. Because of this \r\nreason, AI models can serve as a mediator between the images and the endoscopists. \r\nInstead of shifting through the whole image, the endoscopists can only look at images \r\nthat have been flagged by the AI.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n19 | P a g e  \r\n 3. Project Me thodology  \r\nBefore undertaking any project of a decent size, proper planning is required. Proper plans \r\nand methodology should be set in stone before starting the project.  It is important for \r\nstakeholders to select a project methodology that suits their inter ests. Selecting the right \r\nmethodology is crucial to ensure that the project runs efficiently and that the final project \r\nmeets the needs of the stakeholder. For this project, I have chosen Extreme Programming \r\n(XP) as the project development methodology.  \r\nExtreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development paradigm that seeks to \r\ndeliver software of a better caliber while also improving the team\'s quality of life  (Agile \r\nAlliance, 2023) . Of the agile frameworks, XP is the most explicit in terms of the proper \r\nengineering techniques for software development.  It is excellent for any project which \r\nrequires a high level of flexibility and adaptability, which is true in our case. Any machine \r\nlearning project requires a high level of f lexibility. XP also focused on continuous  testing \r\nand integration. For any machine learning model to be deployed continuous testing is \r\nrequired both on the testing data and the real word data. If the model does not perform \r\nwell, it needs to be replaced  with a newer model.  XP also puts emphasis on frequent \r\nreleases and feedback. The feedback from stakeholders and domain professionals can \r\nbe taken into consideration for making changes to the model’s architecture.  \r\n4. Tools and Technologies  \r\n4.1. Software  \r\n4.1.1. Python  \r\nPython is an open -source programming language  commonly used in the field of machine \r\nlearning and data science. Python contains a large number  of frameworks and libraries \r\nlike TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV which are suitable for working with images and \r\nmachine learning models. Python codes are also easy to read and manage and can be \r\nscaled.  \r\n 20 | P a g e  \r\n 4.1.2. Django  \r\nDjango is a Python framework which can  be used to create web applications. Django, by \r\ndefault, provides a lot of web security features without needing to write code. This makes \r\nit suitable for projects involving sensitive data. Django can also be used to create REST \r\nAPIs that are scalable.  \r\n \r\n4.1.3. PyTorch  \r\n PyTorch i s an open -source Machine Learning framework used to develop and train deep \r\nneural networks. PyTorch provides a dynamic computational graph that allows for efficient \r\ncomputation of gradients during the backpropagation of CNNs. PyTorch  also has \r\nintegrated with CUDA which allows us to train machine learning models in the GPU. \r\nTraining in the GPU is a lot faster than training in CPU because of the number  of cores \r\nwe have in GPU. PyTorch also provides an easy API to create very complex mod els and \r\nallows us to use models that have  already been built by other engineers.  \r\n \r\n4.1.4. React and Tailwind CSS  \r\nReact is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces that provides a \r\ncomponent -based approach . It is an excellent choice for the f ront-end of this project \r\nbecause it helps to  create a modular, responsive, and interactive user interface that can \r\nhandle the image and video data. Because of the dynamic nature of my project and usage \r\nof multiple REST APIs, React was a better choice for t his project than vanilla JavaScript. \r\nTailwind CSS is a CSS library that allows us to style our webpage without explicitly writing \r\nCSS code. Using Tailwind, different class names can be added to component to style it. \r\nThis results in less code and less mess y file structure . \r\n \r\n4.1.5 . Visual Studio Code  \r\nVisual Studio Code in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by \r\nMicrosoft. Since it provides multiple useful extensions like Error Lens, Git Lens, Jupyter 21 | P a g e  \r\n Notebook, VS Code has been my primary IDE  for development of the web application \r\nand training of the model.  \r\n \r\n4.1.6. Git and GitHub  \r\nGit is a version control system that can be used to manage and track changes in codes. \r\nGitHub is a code -hosting service that integrates with Git. Keeping track of cha nges in \r\ncode knowing you can revert back to previous versions if things do not work out is the \r\nmain advantage of using Git.  \r\n \r\n4.2. Hardware  \r\n4.2.1 Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060 6GB  \r\nThe model for this project was trained on a laptop with Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060 car d \r\nwith 6 GB of VRAM. In some cases, where 6GB of RAM was not enough, the model was \r\ntrained on Google Collab which offers 12GB of RAM but with less computational power.  \r\n \r\n5.

System Sequence Diagram  \r\n \r\nFigure 33: System Sequence Diagram  \r\n6. Model Design  and Training  \r\n6.1. Data Collection  \r\nGetting personal medical data is not easy. Luckily, there was a public dataset named \r\nHyperKvasir dataset (Borgli, et al., 2020) . The dataset contained about 44,000 images \r\nand 43 videos of length s ranging from 10 minutes to 30 m inutes. Since the videos were \r\nunlabeled, they were discarded for training. They were later manually clipped for testing. \r\nThe 4 8,000 images consisted of 14 classes:  \r\n- Normal Mucosa  \r\n- Pylorus  \r\n- Ileocecal Valve  \r\n- Ampulla of Vater  \r\n- Reduced Mucosal View  \r\n44 | P a g e  \r\n - Ulcer  \r\n- Polyp  \r\n- Foreign Bodies  \r\n- Erythematous  \r\n- Erosion  \r\n- Blood - Fresh  \r\n- Blood - Hematin  \r\n- Angiectasia  \r\n- Lymphangiectasia  \r\n \r\n6.2. Data Balancing  \r\nWith the help of Dr. Sagun Karki, I classified these 14 classes into two general classes: \r\nNormal and Pathological.  \r\n  \r\nClass Type  Class Name  Count  \r\nNormal  Normal Mucosa  34338  \r\nNormal  Pylorus  1529  \r\nNormal  Ileocecal Valve  4189  \r\nNormal  Ampulla of Vater  10 \r\nNormal  Reduced Mucosal View  2906  \r\nPathological  Ulcer  854 \r\nPathological  Polyp  55 45 | P a g e  \r\n Pathological  Foreign Bodies  776 \r\nPathological  Erythematous  159 \r\nPathological  Erosion  506 \r\nPathological  Blood - Fresh  446 \r\nPathological  Blood - Hematin  12 \r\nPathological  Angiectasia  866 \r\nPathological  Lymphangiectasia  592 \r\n \r\nThis was done for two reasons. First, to balance out the data since it is highly imbalanced , \r\nand second for clarity purpose s. For a layman, these two classes make much more sense \r\nthan specialized terms.  \r\nAs mentioned, the dataset was highly imbalanced with over 43000 images belonging to \r\nthe normal class  and only 5000 images belon ging to the pathological class. Four out of \r\nthe five normal classes had very large amo unt of images, so I wanted to sample them. \r\nTo get the number of images to sample from each class, I divided the number of images \r\nrequired by 4  which was 1212.  The samplin g method I chose was uniform sampling since \r\nthe images near each other were very similar.  46 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 34: Data Under sampling using Uniform Sampling  \r\nAfter sampling there w as an equal number  of images in the two general classes; Normal  \r\nand Pathological.  \r\n \r\n6.4. In -memory Data Augmentation  \r\nThe problem with many machine learning models is their inability to generalize to real -\r\nworld data. The distribution of data used for training may not always be representative of \r\nthe distribution of real -world data. For example, if we only have data that ha ve blood \r\npresent in the bottom -right part of the image, the model might not be able to recognize \r\nblood in other parts  of the image if it is in another shape or form. To solve this, we can \r\nuse the in-memory data augmentation feature which is provided by both PyTorch and \r\nTensor Flow. During training, a n image i s augmented to a different form as specified by \r\nthe user. The advantage of in -memory data augmentation over disk -based data \r\naugmentation is tha t it consumes less storage capacity and is faster.  \r\n47 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 35: In-memory data augmentation  \r\nFor all models mentioned below, the following data augmentations have been used:  \r\n• Random Horizontal Flip with a 50% probability  \r\n• Random Vertical Flip with a 50% probability  \r\n• Random Rotation ranging from 30 degre es to 70 degrees.  \r\n \r\n6.5. Data Splitting  \r\nThe data was split in the ratio of 7:1:2 for training, validation,  and testing. The data split \r\nwas done without using any prebuilt libra ries. The data was sp lit into 70% train, 10% \r\nvalidation, and 20% test ensuring that all the dataset s contained the same distribution of \r\nclasses. This is important to ensure that the validation and test scores we are calculating \r\nwill be representative of re al-world  data.  \r\n \r\n48 | P a g e  \r\n 6.6. Model Architecture  \r\nSeeing the success of Residual Network s in classification task s for digestive endoscopy, \r\nI have used ResNet50 as my model. The number 50 refers to the depth of the network.  \r\nThe a dvantage of ResNet over other deep lea rning models is that this model’s \r\nperformance doesn’t degrade with increase in layer s. The skip connection in ResNet \r\nallows for an easier flow of gradients.  49 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 36: Architecture of ResNet50  \r\n50 | P a g e  \r\n 6.7. Loss Function and Optimizer  \r\nCross Entropy Loss was chosen as the loss function for this task because the data is \r\nmulti -classe d. It is a measure of the difference between the predicted probability \r\ndistribution of the model and the actual probability distribution of the true labels. By using \r\nthis loss function, the optimizer tries to maximize the probability of an item  belonging to a \r\nclass. The main advantage of this loss function is that it penalizes the model when it \r\npredicts an incorrect class with high confidence.  \r\nSince th e specific classes were also imbalanced, weights were given  to the loss functions. \r\nFor classes with very little data (only 10 images of Ampulla of Vater), high weights were \r\ngiven. So, when the model misclassifies a class with high weightage, the normal los s is \r\nmultiplied by the weight. This allows the model to also focus on the class having very little \r\ndata.  \r\nAdam was chosen as the optimizer for this task because of its robustness compared to \r\nother optimizers. It includes features of both AdaGrad (to scale t he learning rate for each \r\nparameter based on historical gradients) and RMSProp (to smooth out gradients and \r\nspeed up convergence). These features of Adam make it robust for most machine \r\nlearning tasks including this one.  \r\n6.8. Evaluation Metric  \r\nThe primary evaluation metric chosen for this project was the F1 score. The F1 score is \r\nthe harmonic mean of Recall and Precision. Recall can be defined as the model’s ability \r\nto correct ly find all positive classes. A recall of 0.8 would mean that out of 100 positive \r\nclasses, the model was only able to predict 80% of those 100 classes. Precision can be \r\ndefined as the model’s ability to accurately make predictions. If a model makes 100 \r\npositive predictions but 20 of them are incorrect, the model is said to have 0.8 prec ision.  \r\nRecall gives the mean of these two terms.  \r\n 51 | P a g e  \r\n 6.9. Model Training and Opt imization  \r\nInstead of training one model and tuning it s hyperparameter, multiple models varying in \r\nboth architecture and hyperparameter were  trained and evaluated on both classification \r\nperformance and localization performance.  \r\nDisclaimer:  \r\nDuring the initial phases of training, while plotting the confusion mat rix, class ids were \r\nused instead of class names. Below is the mapping for the class index to names:  \r\n• Ampulla of Vater: 0  \r\n• Angiectasia: 1  \r\n• Blood - fresh: 2  \r\n• Blood - hematin: 3  \r\n• Erosion: 4  \r\n• Erythema: 5  \r\n• Foreign body: 6  \r\n• Ileocecal valve: 7  \r\n• Lymphangiectasia: 8  \r\n• Normal clean mucosa: 9  \r\n• Polyp: 10  \r\n• Pylorus: 11  \r\n• Reduced mucosal view:  12 \r\n• Ulcer: 13  \r\n \r\n6.9.1. Scratch ResNet 50 \r\nInitially , the plan was to train the model from scratch weights.  \r\nHyperparameters:  \r\n• Batch Size: 32  \r\n• Learning Rate: 0.001  \r\n• Weighted Loss : No 52 | P a g e  \r\n • Dropouts: 0.2  \r\n• Max Epochs: 100  \r\n \r\nFigure 37: Training and Validation loss of Scratch ResNet50  \r\n \r\nFigure 38: Training and Validation accuracy of ResNet50  \r\nIn the graph above, it can be observed that the validation loss and accuracy is fluctuating \r\na lot.  Even though there is a lot of fluctuation, the trends in loss seem to be going down, \r\nwhich indicates that the model is not overfitting. It could also be the cause of less batch \r\n53 | P a g e  \r\n size. All 14 classes may not  be in a single batch of validation, which could result in \r\nfluctuations. This can also be the cause of less data.   \r\n \r\nFigure 39: Confusion Matrix of ResNet50 for test data  \r\nIt can be seen from the confusion matrix that the model has performed well with an F1  \r\nScore of 0.876 and an accuracy of 90% on the test dataset.  Although this model can be \r\ndeemed fit for use in the real  world based on the metrics above, the localization was not \r\nvery appealing.  \r\n \r\nFigure 40: Localization visualization for scratch ResNet50 (1)   \r\n54 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 41: Localization visualization for scratch ResNet50 ( 2) \r\n \r\nFigure 42: Localization visualization for scratch ResNet50 ( 3) \r\n55 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 43: Localization visualization for scratch ResNet50 ( 4) \r\nIn the image groups above, the image on the left side of the group is the original image, \r\nand the one in the middle is the heatmap generated by Grad -CAM where red denotes \r\nthat the model is focusing on that part for prediction and blue denotes that the model has \r\nfewer  weights assigned to those parts. The image on the right side of the group is the \r\nheatmap overlayed on the original image.  \r\nIn the first three image groups, the anom alies are red and in the fourth one, the anomaly \r\nis the white part of the image.  While looking at the heatmaps, we can see that the model \r\nhas not learned properly and is not basing its prediction on the infected part of the image.  \r\nMost of the heatmaps abov e are covered by red which means that the model looks at all \r\nparts of the image with equal weightage. This problem could be the reason for training \r\nthe model from scratch weights. Since there w ere very fewer  data as compared to how \r\nlarge of a dataset these  models are trained on, the model was not able to learn high -level \r\ntask-specific features.  \r\n \r\n6.9.2. Finetuning ResNet50  \r\nTransfer Learning  \r\nWith limited hardware capability and limited data, it is hard to train a machine -learning \r\nmodel that can perform on par with other state -of-the-art models.  Instead of training a \r\nnew model from scratch, we can leverage the power of transfer learning. Transfer learning \r\n56 | P a g e  \r\n refers to the method of taking a machine learning model that has alre ady been trained on \r\na huge dataset and retraining it in our small dataset for our task. This works, especially  in \r\nCNN, because the initial layers of CNN are responsible for learning low -level features \r\nsuch as edges, lines, and shapes. These features are us eful for every kind of task. So, \r\nwe can take the initial layers of CNN models that ha ve already been trained, remove the \r\nfully connected layers responsible for learning the relationship, freeze the weights of the \r\nconvolutional layers , and add our own fully  connected layer suitable for our task.  \r\n \r\nFigure 44: Transfer Learning Methodology  \r\nFor this task, I chose ResNet50 trained on the ImageNet dataset (Stanford Vision Lab, \r\n2021) . Different variations of th e fully connected layers were used but I will be discussing \r\ntwo architectures in detail.  \r\n- Architecture 1 ( ResNet50  Pretrained  1) \r\no Architecture  \r\n▪ Dense Layer (14 neurons)  \r\no Epochs  \r\n▪ 20 \r\n \r\n- Architecture 2 ( ResNet50  Pretrained  2) \r\no Architecture  \r\n▪ Dense Layer (512 neurons)  \r\n▪ Dropout (0.5 probability)  \r\n▪ Dense Layer (14 neurons)  \r\no Epochs  \r\n▪ 5 \r\nWith very few changes in the architecture, there was a drastic change in the performance \r\nof the localization.  Unlike training the model from scratch, the training loss and validation \r\nloss decreased smoothly on both of these architectures.  \r\n57 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 45: Training and Validation loss for Pretrained ResNet50   \r\n \r\nFigure 46: Training and Validation accuracy for Pretrained ResNet50  \r\nThe training seems to saturate at about 20 epochs with less decrease in loss after that \r\npoint.  \r\n58 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 47: Confusion Matrix of ResNet50  Pretrained  1 \r\n \r\nFigure 48: Confusion Matrix of Re sNet50  Pretrained  2 \r\n \r\nFigure 49: AUC and Sensitivity of ResNet50 Pretrained 1  \r\n59 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 50: AUC and Sensitivity of ResNet50 Pretrained 2  \r\n \r\n \r\nThere seems to be a negligible change in classification performance with a change in \r\nmodel architecture.  Altogether, it seems to perform better than training the model from \r\nscratch.  \r\n \r\nLegend:  \r\n- Blue Glow: ResNet50  Pretrained  1 \r\n- Orange Glow: ResNet50  Pretrained  2 \r\n  \r\n60 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 51: Localization visualization for  ResNet50 Pretrained 1  (1) \r\n  \r\n \r\nFigure 52: Localization visualization for ResNet50 Pretrained 2 (1) \r\n61 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 53: Localization visualization f or ResNet50 Pretrained 1 ( 2) \r\n \r\nFigure 54: Localization visualization for ResNet50 Pretrained 2 (2) \r\n \r\n \r\n62 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 55: Localization visualization for ResNet50 Pretrained 1 ( 3) \r\n \r\nFigure 56: Localization visualization for ResNet50 Pretrained 2 (3) \r\n \r\n  \r\n63 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 57: Localization visualization for ResNet50 Pretrained 1 (4) \r\n \r\nFigure 58: Localization visualization for Res Net50 Pretrained 2 (4) \r\n \r\n  \r\n64 | P a g e  \r\n  \r\nFigure 59: Localization visualization for ResNet50 Pretrained 1 ( 5) \r\n \r\nFigure 60: Localization visualization for ResNet50 Pretrained 2 (5) \r\nFrom the localizations provided above by  the two models, it can be seen that the first \r\nmodel gives localization in fewer  spaces with more confidence (darker reds and blues) , \r\nand the second model gives localization in multiple spaces with less con fidence (light \r\nreds, light blues, green, yellow).  The reason for this to happen could be because of less \r\namount of layers in the fully connected layer. The first model only has one dense layer \r\nwhereas the second model has two dense layer s. When there are less dense layers, the \r\nfeature maps genera ted by the convolutional layers should be more featureful and \r\n65 | P a g e  \r\n informative than can be used without much modification. This allows the model to learn \r\nvery high -level features which in  turn results in high -confidence localizations.  \r\n \r\n6.10. Integration with th e system  \r\nThe model was trained separately, and the weights of the models were saved. The \r\nconnection of the AI was done with the system using a REST API which was developed \r\nusing the Django REST framework. Instead of creating one API which does all the task s \r\nfrom data pre-processing  to classification and localization, I created multiple API s serving \r\nspecific purpose s. This was done to give the user information about the task that was \r\nbeing done in the present.  The API endpoints used for the connection of the  AI with the \r\nsystem are listed below in order of usage.  \r\n \r\n6.10.1. /patient -info API \r\nRequest Type: POST  \r\nPayload:  \r\n- name : Name of the patient  \r\n- patients_age : Age of the patient  \r\n- detail : Extra details of the patient  \r\n- file: Endoscopic video or image  \r\n \r\nThis API is called when the patient’s  information is first given by the user. This API \r\nstores the data in the database and must be called before calling other APIs.   \r\n \r\n6.10.2. /crop API  \r\nRequest TYPE: POST  \r\nPayload:  66 | P a g e  \r\n - patient_id : ID of the patient who se video/image to crop.  \r\n- x: Start position of the crop in the x-axis. \r\n- y: Start position of the crop in the y-axis. \r\n- w: Width of output video/image  \r\n- h: Height of output video/image  \r\nThe model only takes input images with the aspect ratio of 1:1 but most of the vid eos and \r\nimages are in the format of 16:9. This problem left unattended seriously hampers the \r\nmodel’s prediction capability. To solve this, all images/videos are cropped to the \r\ndimensions provided by the user.  \r\n \r\n6.10.3. /video -to-image  API \r\nRequest Type: POST  \r\nPayload:  \r\n- patient_id: ID of the patient whose videos to convert into images.  \r\nThe model also only takes images and inputs. So, videos need to be converted to images \r\nbefore they can be processed by the model. This endpoint  converts the pati ent’s video \r\nfile to images.  \r\n \r\n6.10.4. /resize -images  API \r\nRequest Type: POST  \r\nPayload:  \r\n- patients_id: ID of the patient whose images to resize.  \r\nSince the model takes images of a certain input size, it is necessary to convert all images \r\nto the size accepted by the model. This API resizes all images to the size so that they can \r\nbe fed into the model.  \r\n 67 | P a g e  \r\n 6.10.5. /predict  API \r\nRequest Type: POST  \r\nPayload : \r\n- patients_id: ID of the patient whose images to get classifications and localizations \r\nfor \r\nThis is the main API endpoint responsible for generating classifications and localizations.  \r\nFirst, it checks whether the patient id exists or not and if it does not, it throws an error. \r\nAfter that , it loads all of the images that need to be fed to the model into a DataLoader \r\nwhich feed s the data to the model in batches. The prediction model i s initialized and the \r\nweights fit into the model. All of the images are fed to the model in batches, a nd the \r\npredictions are stored in the database.  After predictions, the data is again forward passed \r\nthrough the model to generate heatmaps. The gradient of all feature maps of the final \r\nlayer is computed and summed up. The output is a low -resolution heatmap  that is scaled \r\nto the size of the image. The heatmap is also overlayed over the original image to better \r\nunderstand the heatmap. Both the heatmap and the overlayed image are saved in the \r\ndatabase.  \r\n \r\n6.10.6. /patient -info/<int:id> API  \r\nRequest Type: GET \r\nThis API endpoint is responsible for showing the results generated by the predict API. \r\nWhenever this endpoint is hit, the data stored in the database are collected and sent to \r\nthe front  end via this API. The results then are shown in a user -friendly way.  \r\n \r\n7. Conclusion  \r\nThe main objective of this project was to develop a system capable of classifying images \r\nof digestive endoscopy along with its localization.  The final model produced has a good \r\nclassification score with an F1 score of 0.95. Given the size of the  dataset and the 68 | P a g e  \r\n hardware the model was trained on, this is a good score. Localizations also seem to be \r\nperforming well which was compared with in cross -reference to a doctor.   \r\nDuring the development phase, the model was trained on a GPU, which is fast. Bu t to \r\nshift the model to production, it needs to run on a CPU to save costs. So, it takes a g ood \r\namount of time to generate predictions and localizations for video. From the results \r\npresented in this report, it is evident that better localizations can be ge nerated by using \r\nless amount of fully connected layers.  This happens because the model needs to \r\ngenerate better feature maps for the less powerful fully connected layers to make correct \r\npredictions . \r\nOverall, this project aimed to create a system capable of  streamlining the diagnosis \r\nprocess of Capsule Digestive Endoscopy by accurately classifying diseases and \r\ngenerating localization.  The localizations can be beneficial in making the model more \r\ntransparent and help attract more possible uses . \r\n8. Critical Ev aluation  \r\nAfter completion of this report, I can say that I have prepared a comprehensive and well -\r\nstructured document that present s the finding of my work.  By writing this report, I have \r\ngained an even deeper understanding of the project I have been doing.  It was truly a one-\r\nof-a-kind experience doing this project from scratch. The most significant finding of my \r\nreport is the change in localization confidence with the change in a number of fully \r\nconnected layers.  It was also a great learning experience as I  was able to familiarize \r\nmyself with technology stacks that are used in the real world for this use case . \r\nInitially, I found it difficult to start this project but as the scope of the project started \r\nbecoming more closed and focused, I was able to make fast progress. The model training \r\npart was also stressful as it took a lot of time to train the model and I needed to change \r\nhyperparameters every so often.  Overall, I believe I have created a system that can be \r\ndeployed to be used in a real hospital. The user interface is very user -friendly and minimal, \r\nand the machine learning model has good evaluation scores. The heatmaps generated \r\nare also of good quality.  69 | P a g e  \r\n Being someone who has always been interested in AI and wanted to start his career in \r\nAI, this proj ect has been a huge contributor to my success. During the lifecycle of this \r\nproject, I was able to land a job at a prestigious Nepali company as a n ML Engineer. I \r\nbelieve that the amount of research and time I had poured into this project was a key \r\nfactor in my getting that job.  70 | P a g e  \r\n 9. Evidence of Project Management  \r\n9.1.

the initial layers of CNN models that ha ve already been trained, remove the \r\nfully connected layers responsible for learning the relationship, freeze the weights of the \r\nconvolutional layers ,

The first rush of pleasure or joy fades off with a period much like the moment you get used to everything fun or interesting. As an example, the sense of achievement that comes with getting an updated cell phone ultimately fades off because, while it may feel awesome at first, it quickly turns into a new normal.

Teens may mitigate the impact of this by adopting financial accountability, offering financial goals for the future the most importance, and seeking enjoyment and experiences in life instead of material things. David, for instance, often wastes money buying fashionable clothes to be up-to-date with the most recent trends. He feels pleased after each fresh piece of clothing he purchases, but his initial excitement diminishes very quickly as a result of the speed with which the latest fashions change. His collected expenses on trends may result in his financial trouble without providing him with long-term fulfillment.\n\nC, Teams can set specific budget objectives, including saving for a future vacation or university, to offset the effect of hedonic adaptation while making better choices regarding their finances. Set priorities and efforts that will end up resulting in lasting fulfillment over temporary pleasures. As opposed to hurrying into buying decisions, we can learn how to wait for things. Setting away money for a wanted item, which might improve its general worth and pleasure upon purchase can be considered. Spend money on opportunities (like vacations and activities) instead of goods. The longer-lasting joy and recollections are frequently generated by events. Money can be saved every single month from the allowance or payment as well.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the end, shopping is a multifaceted activity that is shaped by advertising, customs of culture, individual expression, and fundamental needs. The concept of hedonic adaptation highlights the challenges of achieving a balance between short-term happiness and long-term fulfillment, and it is particularly relevant to teenagers. People may approach shopping with greater financial accountability and overall happiness when they set clear budgetary goals, give long-term goals importance, and find satisfaction through activities instead of material things.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection ko answer\n\nTo overcome the impact of transitory impulses, we need to foster mindfulness and establish strategies for preventing impulsive decisions when scrolling via the Internet and paying attention to hedonic adaptation. The luxury of the choice to wait before purchasing something when we come across something that attracts us. Evaluation can be done to see if our desire to buy is a result of an urgent need or a passing pleasure. We may set an amount of time before buying any things that are not essential. We can give it at least one day to reflect on whether the product is value of money. There might also be a budget made aside for free money spent on unnecessary things. By identifying objectives for our buying decisions, we can make sure that our money gets spent on goods that improve our standards of living. Regularly update the feats we receive on social media by ignoring profiles that make us hesitate to make sudden purchases and unsubscribe from emails that provide special and savings opportunities all of the time. Urge ourselves regularly to be appreciative of everything that we have right now and to take inventory of our assets. The continuous craving for more could be mitigated by focusing on appreciation. Evaluate the impact that whatever we purchase is going to have on the natural world and how it affects our health. Instead of concentrating on the instant excitement, contemplate the item\'s long-term worth and satisfaction.', NULL, 0, 'why-do-we-shopdocx', '2024-02-01 12:06:44', '2024-02-09 19:58:54'),

Money can be saved every single month from the allowance or payment as well (Lyubomirsky, 2010).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.N.4, (Reflection Question)\r\n\r\nTo overcome the impact of transitory impulses, we need to foster mindfulness and establish strategies for preventing impulsive decisions when scrolling via the Internet and paying attention to hedonic adaptation. The luxury of the choice to wait before purchasing something when we come across something that attracts us. Evaluation can be done to see if our desire to buy is a result of an urgent need or a passing pleasure. We may set an amount of time before buying any things that are not essential. We can give it at least one day to reflect on whether the product is value of money. There might also be a budget made aside for free money spent on unnecessary things. By identifying objectives for our buying decisions, we can make sure that our money gets spent on goods that improve our standards of living. Regularly update the feats we receive on social media by ignoring profiles that make us hesitate to make sudden purchases and unsubscribe from emails that provide special and savings opportunities all of the time. \r\n\r\nWe can urge ourselves regularly to be appreciative of everything that we have right now and to take inventory of our assets. The continuous craving for more could be mitigated by focusing on appreciation. Evaluate the impact that whatever we purchase is going to have on the natural world and how it affects our health. Instead of concentrating on the instant excitement, contemplate the item\'s long-term worth and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn the end, shopping is a multifaceted activity that is shaped by advertising, customs of culture, individual expression, and fundamental needs. The concept of hedonic adaptation highlights the challenges of achieving a balance between short-term happiness and long-term fulfillment, and it is particularly relevant to teenagers. People may approach shopping with greater financial accountability and overall happiness when they set clear budgetary goals, give long-term goals importance, and find satisfaction through activities instead of material things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReference\r\n\r\nHorváth, C., & Adıgüzel, F.

Each task should be zipped up into a single zip \nfolder containing all C/CUDA and resource files for the submission on Canvas.  \n1. Password cracking using multithreading  (15% - 100 marks)  \nIn this task, you will be asked to use the “crypt” library to decrypt a password using \nmultithreading. You will be provided with two programs. The first program called \n“EncryptSHA512.c”  which  allows you to encrypt a password. For this assessment , you will be \nrequired to decrypt a 4-character  password consisting of 2 capital  letters, and 2 numbers. The \nformat of the password should be “LetterLetterNumberNumber.” For example, “HP93.” Once \nyou have generated your password, this should then be entered into your program to decrypt \nthe password.  The method of input for the encrypted password is up to you.  The second \nprogram is a  skeleton code to crack the password in regular C without any multithread ing \nsyntax. Your task is to use multithreading  to split the workload over many threads  and find the \npassword. Once the password has been found, the program should finish meaning not all \ncombinations of 2 letters and 2 numbers should be explored unless it’s  ZZ99 and the last thread \nhappens to finish last.  \nCracks a p assword using multithreading and dynamic slicing based on thread count (75  marks)  \nProgram finishes appropriately when password has been found (25  marks)  \n  \n2. Matrix Multiplication using multithreadi ng (25% - 100 marks)  \nYou will create a matrix multiplication program which uses multithreading. Matrices are often \ntwo-dimensional arrays varying in sizes, for your application, you will only need to multiply two -\ndimensional ones. Your program will read in  the matrices from a supplied file (txt), store them \nappropriately using dynamic memory allocation features and multiply them by splitting the tasks \nacross “n” threads (any amount of threads). You should use command line arguments to specify \nwhich file to read from (argv[1]) and the number of threads to use (argv[2]). If the number of \nthreads requested by the user is greater than the biggest dimension of the matrices to be \nmultiplied, the actual number of threads used in the calculation should be limited to  the \nmaximum dimension of the matrices. Your program should be able to take “any” size matrices \nand multiply them depending on the data found within the file. Some sizes of matrices cannot be \nmultiplied together, for example, if Matrix A is 3x3 and Matrix B is 2x2, you cannot multiply \nthem. If Matrix A is 2x3 and Matrix B is 3x2, then this can be multiplied. You will need to \nresearch how to multiply matrices, this will also be covered in the lectures (briefly). If the \nmatrices cannot be multiplied, your pro gram should output an error message notifying the user \nand move on to the next pair of matrices. Your program should store the results of your \nsuccessful matrix multiplications in a text file – for every 2 matrices, there should be one \nresulting matrix. As  a minimum, you are expected to use the standard C file handling functions: \nfopen(), fclose(), fscanf(), and fprintf(), to read and to write your files. stdin and stdout \nredirection will not be acceptable.  \nRead data from file appropriately ( 20 marks)  \nUsin g dynamic memory (malloc) for matrix A and matrix B (10 marks)  \nCreating an algorithm to multiply matrices correctly (20 marks)  \nUsing multithreading with equal computations (30 marks)  \nStoring the correct output matrices in the correct format to a file (20 marks)  \n \n3. Password Cracking using CUDA  (30% - 100 marks)  \nUsing a similar concept as question 2, you will now crack passwords using CUDA. As a kernel \nfunction cannot use the crypt library, you will be given an encryption function instead which will \ngenera te a password for you.  Your program will take in an encrypted password and decrypt it \nusing many threads on the GPU. CUDA allows multidimensional thread configurations so your \nkernel function (which runs on the GPU) will need to be modified according to h ow you call your \nfunction.  \nGenerate encrypted password  in the kernel function (using CudaCrypt function)  to be \ncompared to original encrypted password (25  marks)  \nAllocating the correct amount of memory on the GPU based on input data. Memory is freed \nonce used (15  marks)  \nProgram works with multiple blocks and threads  – the number of blocks and threads will \ndepend on your kernel function. You will not be penalised if your program only works with a set number of blocks and threads however, your program must u se more than one block (axis \nis up to you) and more than one thread (axis is up to you)  (40 marks)  \nDecrypted password sent back to the CPU and printed  (20 marks)  \n \n4. Box Blur using CUDA (30% - 100 marks)   \nYour program will decode a PNG file into an array and apply the box blur filter. Blurring an image \nreduces noise by taking the average RGB values around a specific pixel and setting its RGB to the \nmean values you’ve just calculated. This smoothens the colour across a matrix of pixels. For this \nassessment, you will use a 3 x3 matrix. For example, if you have a 5x5 image such as the \nfollowing (be aware that the coordinate values will depend on how you format your 2D array):  \n \n0,4 1,4 2,4 3,4 4,4 \n0,3 1,3 2,3 3,3 4,3 \n0,2 1,2 2,2 3,2 4,2 \n0,1 1,1 2,1 3,1 4,1 \n0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0 4,0 \n \nThe shaded region above represents the pixel we want to blur, in this case, we are focusing on \npixel 1,2  (x,y) (Centre of the matrix). T o apply the blur for this pixel, you would sum all the Red \nvalues from the surrounding coordinates including 1,2 (total of 9 R values) and find the average \n(divide by 9). This is now the new Red value for coordinate 1,2. You must then repeat this for \nGreen and Blue values. This must be repeated throughout the ima ge. If you are working on a \npixel which is not fully surrounded by pixels (8 pixels), you must take the average of however \nmany neighbouring pixels there are.  \n \nYour task is to use CUDA to blur an image. Your number of blocks and threads should in an ideal  \nscenario reflect the dimension of the image however, there are limits to the amount of blocks \nand threads you can spawn in each dimension (regarding block and thread dimensions (x,y,z). \nYou will not be penalised if you do not use different dimensions of b locks and threads, for this \nassessment, we will accept just one dimensional blocks and threads, e.g. \nfunction<<<blockNumber, threadNumber>>>  \n \nReading in an image fi le into a single or 2D array (5  marks)  \nAllocating the correct amount of memory on the GPU ba sed on input data.

This is to ensure the \nwork has been completed by the student . \n \nYou must achieve 40 percent overall to pass this module. There will be a resit opportunity during \nresit week (July) to achieve a pass.  \n \nSubmission of work  \nYour completed work for assignments must be handed in on or before the due date. You must keep \na copy or backup of any assessed work that you submit.  Failure to do so may result in your having \nto repeat that piece of work.  \n \nPenalties for late submission of coursework  \nStandard Faculty of Science and Technology arrangements apply.  \nANY late submission (without valid cause) will result in 0 marks being allocated  to the coursework . \n \nProcedure for requesting extensions  \nIf you have a valid reason for requiring an extension you must request an extension using e:vision. \nRequests for extension to assignment deadlines should normally be submitted  before the \nsubmission deadline and may be granted for a maximum of seven days (one calendar week).  \n  \nRetrieval of Failur e \nA pass of 40% or above must be obtained overall for the module (but not necessarily in each \nassessment task).  \nWhere a student fails a module they have the right to attempt the failed assessment(s) once, at \nthe next resit opportunity (normally July resit  period).   If a student fails assessment for a second \ntime they have a right to repeat (i.e. RETAKE) the module.  \n \nNOTE:  STUDENTS  WHO  DO NOT  TAKE  THEIR  RESIT  AT THE  NEXT  AVAILABLE  RESIT  OPPORTUNITY  \nWILL  BE REQUIRED  TO REPEAT  THE  MODULE .  \n \nMitigating Circumstances (also called Extenuating Circumstances).  \nIf you are unable to meet a deadline or attend an examination, and you have a valid reason, then \nyou will need to request via e:vision Extenuating Circumstances.   \n \nFeedback of assignments  \nYou will be given feedback when you demonstrate your work.  \n \nYou normally have two working weeks from the date you receive your grade and feedback to \ncontact and discuss the matter with your lecturer. See the Student’s Union advice page \nhttp://www.wolvesunion.org/adviceandsupport/  for more details.  \nRegistration  \nPlease ensure that you are registered on the module. You can check your module registrations via \ne:Vision You should see your personal tutor or the Student Support Officer if you are unsure about \nyour programme of study. The fact that you are attending mod ule classes does not mean that you \nare necessarily registered. A grade may not be given if you are not registered.  \n Cheating  \nCheating is any attempt to gain unfair advantage by dishonest means and includes plagiarism  and \ncollusion.  Cheating is a serious of fence. You are advised to check the nature of each assessment. You \nmust work individually unless it is a group assessment.  \n \nCheating  is defined as any attempt by a candidate to gain unfair advantage in an assessment by \ndishonest means, and includes e.g . all breaches of examination room rules, impersonating another \ncandidate, falsifying data, and obtaining an examination paper in advance of its authorised release.  \n \nPlagiarism  is defined as incorporating a significant amount of un -attributed direct quotati on from, or \nun-attributed substantial paraphrasing of, the work of another.  \n \nCollusion occurs when two or more students collaborate to produce a piece of work to be submitted \n(in whole or part) for assessment and the work is presented as the work of one st udent alone.

Introduction  \nThis project is game development which is related to open -world gameplay. It aims to \ncreate a 3D platform open -world game named “Fractured Memories”. This open -world \nadventure game re -unities the mission of the family, the characters will have to survive \nin the wild with some skills and their available resources. This project focuses on a \ndynamic environment. The game has a realistic feature of change in time and weather \nof the game environment. The narrative will evolve alongside the changing time and \nweat her. Within this game the player will be able to interact and collect the resources \navailable. The game will consist of Non-Pedestrian  Characters (NPCs) making the \ngame more realistic.  \nThe targeted audience for this game primarily consists of individuals who have a keen \ninterest in open -world gaming experiences, particularly  within the survival game genre. \nThe game will cater  to a sense of freedom and exploration, allowing players to interact \nwith the dynamic and unpredictable virtual world.  This is the proposed overview of the \ngame where the players can also gather things available, and based on different \ntactics the player needs to survive.  \n \n2. Aims and Objectives  \n2.1 Aims  \n1. The player can feel nature and enjoy the gameplay without any restrictions.  \n2. This game will help the player to know the survival and crafting skills which can \nbe related in the real world.  \n3. This game also has some quests and missions which will help to increase the \ngeneral knowledge and IQ of the player.  \n4. The game can help in releasing stress and improve self -satisfaction on winning  \ndifferent stages of the game.  \n5. The game will help players  to live a life inside an environment where they can \nexperience a world they would enjoy.  2 | Page  \n 2.2 Objective  \n1. To provide the player with the opportunity to play the game with their own \nchoices whether they want to continue the mission or explore the world.  \n2. To develop a 3D open world game using Unity and Blender . \n3. To implement a realistic environment where the player can experience day, \nnight , and season change.  \n4. To implement survival tactics and character growth in the game while playing \nand experiencing it.  \n \n3. Problem Statement  \nGame enthusiasts face device compatibility issues since different platforms may have \ndifferent specifications which can lead to difficulties in making games work consistently \nacross different platforms.  The gamers do want to experience a game that can help \nboost their mood and help them to tackle stress, loneliness, and depression. The game \nthat has been proposed will help players to interact in an open world. Players do enjoy \na game where they are free to do anything. This gives them a sense of freedom and \njoy in exploration.  \n \n4. Project as Solution  \nAs the character progresses through the story, the skills and ability of the character \nwill develop, providing players feel like they made progress and achieved something \nin the real -world. This game will motivate the player to explore the expansive world of \nthe game, discovering hidden locations and exciting encounters. Lastly , this game will \ndeliver some feelings of importance, loss, love,  and happiness to the player.  \n \n \n \n 3 | Page  \n 5. Scope and Limitations  \n5.1 Scope  \n1. This is an open -world game, the player will have freedom to make significant \ndecisions that will impact the gameplay and can explore the world without any \nrestrictions.  \n2. A game for gamers  with low specifications computer interested in open world \ngames . \n3. During the gameplay, the player might get stuck at some point if the character \nis unable to solve the quests which may decrease the interest of continuing the \ngame. Also, some unidentified bugs may also ruin the gameplay.  \n \n5.2 Limitations  \n1. Although this is an offline story -based game, we can still face the optimization \nissues for the less powerful system of the player.  \n2. Budget constraints may affect the ability to acquire assets like trees, cars,  and \nother environmental elements in the developmental phase.  \n3. As an individual developer, challenges in debugging, identifying the bugs and \nglitches can be time consuming and complex.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 | Page  \n 6.  Literature Review  \nThe Development of 3D Survival Simulation Game for Identifying Safe \nFood and Water in Borneo Forest (Kurniawan, et al., 2020)  \nTraditional methods of teaching survival skills, especially the ability to identify safe \nfood and water in challenging environments often rely on verbal approaches, which \nmay not properly convey practical information to students. Researchers have \ninvestiga ted the use of games as an alternative and useful learning medium to address \nthis restriction, particularly simulation games. This literature review aims to examine \nthe development and effectiveness of a 3D survival simulation game designed to teach \nplayer s how to identify safe food and water in the Borneo Forest.  \nThe concept of this game was developed based on the learning material, teaching \nmethod, gameplay, setting, and plot. The main scenario of this game is Borneo Island, \nknown for rich flora and natural beauty, making it an ideal location for adventure. The \nresearch aimed to address this issue by using a simulation game to help players \ndistinguish between edible and toxic substances.  \nThe game involves four missions, each increasing in complexity and difficulty. These \nmissions teach players different techniques for identifying safe food and water, such \nas recognizing plant characteristics and performing irritation testing. In the materi al \ncollection stage, the researchers collected images, 3D objects with textures, 3D \ncharacters, audio, and animations needed for the game. Most 3D assets were \nobtained from Unity Assets Store, and any necessary modifications were made using \nBlender. The as sembly stage involved the actual game development using Unity game \nengine and Visual Studio as a source code editor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5 | Page  \n 7. Functional Decomposition Diagram  \n \nFigure 1: Functional Decomposition Diagram  \n \n8. Artifacts  \n8.1 3D Assets  \n3D assets include the characters, vehicles, buildings, objects, trees,  and other visible \ngame objects that the player will be able to see while playing the game.  \n8.2 UI/ UX  \nThis will help in the interaction of the player character model with the 3D assets that \nare available in the environment.  \n8.3 Audio Assets  \nThe audio effects such as in game interaction sound, realistic player movement sound, \nthe sound of vehicles and background  music will be the artifacts.  \n8.4 Storyline  \nThe storyline of the game will guide  players through a series of side quests, survival \nand interaction within the virtual world.  \n \n \n6 | Page  \n 9. Software Development Methodology  \nSoftware development methodology is a structured and organized process of \ndeveloping high -quality software quickly and efficiently. The development phase \nconsists of different stages from problem identification, planning, designing, building/ \ndeveloping , testing,  and then deploying the final product. The whole process in \nsoftware development methodology is called Software Development Life Cycle. SDLC \naims to avoid common mistakes in the development phase. The common SDLC \nmodels are waterfall method, spiral method, agile method (Alexandra, 2023) .  \nTo seamlessly track and manage this project, Kanban methodology for software \ndevelopment will be followed. Kanban is a term from the Japan that means billboard \nor signboard. The kanban methodology signifies its meaning as the major principle of \nKanban is t o visualize the work status and progress using the boards. Instead of \ndividing the work in teams, the stakeholder can add request to the backlogs. Kanban \nand Scrum are two agile approaches where Kanban doesn’t define roles focusing on \ncycle whereas scrum h as fixed length sprints, specific roles (Mijacobs, et al., 2022) .   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 | Page  \n 10.

Tools and Technologies  \n12.1 Unity  \nUnity is a powerful tool used by many game developers to create and enhance their \ngames. It is a game engine that provides tools for creating the core functionality of \ngames and serves as an integrated development environment (IDE), helping in coding, \ndesigning, and managing the game elements. Some of the games made with Unity \nare Temple Run, Monument Valley, Ori, and the Blind Forest and many more (Sinicki, \n2021) . \n12.2 Blender  \nBlender is a free and opensource software that helps in creating 2D and 3D elements, \ncharacters and many other objects that require  2D or 3D modeling. Blender is mostly \nused in video, filmmaking, game development, architecture. Blender will be used to \nanimate the characters and design the models and assets of the game environment.  \n12.3 Photoshop  \nAdobe Photoshop is a software that is mostly used for editing, manipulating the photos \nand graphical contents. It is used by designers, photographers, artists,  and other \ncreative background individuals. In this project, photoshop will be used to create the \nbuttons and  images used in the game.  \n12.4 VS Code  \nVS Code is a code editor software developed by Microsoft. This is a good choice to \ninterpret codes  due to tis extensibility, flexibility, and many features that help coding \nseamlessly.  \n12.5 C# \nC# programming language will be used as the fundamental game development \nlanguage helping in implementing game logic with high efficiency. It can be utilized in \nthe Unity Game Engine for scripting, offering the ability to implement game logic, \nphysics, user interaction, and more (Kamau, 2021) .  \n \n \n 9 | Page  \n 13.  Literature Review  \n13.1 The Development of 3D Survival Simulation Game for Identifying Safe \nFood and Water in Borneo Forest  \nIn the Borneo Forest, where getting lost and having a few food and water options acts \nserious survival threats, this research is focused on addressing the difficulties that are \nfaced by the explorers. Traditional methods of teaching survival skills, especially the \nability to identify safe food and water in challenging environments often rely on verbal \napproaches, which may not properly convey practical information to students.  To \novercome this issue, the researchers plan to create a survival simulation game  that \ninstructs players how to identify safe food and water in the Borneo Forest  (Kurniawan, \net al., 2023) . \nBorneo Island, which is known for its rich flora, offers an ideal setting for an adventure \nbut can be dangerous due to its rainforests and vast variety of the plants. The \nadventurers need to have a strong survival skill, particularly the ability to differe ntiate \nthe toxic foods apart from the useful ones. So, the concept of this game was developed \nbased on the learning material, teaching method, gameplay, setting, and plot  \n(Kurniawan, et al., 2023) . \nThe research introduces the idea of using the serious games more specifically, \nsimulation games as a useful and entertaining method of teaching the survival skills \nto the players. The serious games are recognized for their potential to enhances the \nlearnin g experiences. By playing the simulation, it provides a safe environment for \nplayers to experiment and learn without risking in the real world. The game will provide \na practical approach to understand the complex situation and can be highly effective \nas an  educational tool  (Kurniawan, et al., 2023) . \nThe main objective of this research is to create a survival simulation game that teaches \nthe players how to find a clean water and food sources in the Borneo Forest. The plot \nof the game centers around a player and an elderly man getting lost in the forest  and \nhaving to survive while waiting for help. In order to preserve their health, energy and \nfluid levels, players must find food and water. Through a series of tests and \ninteractions, the player must identity safe sources while avoiding those that are tox ic \n(Kurniawan, et al., 2023) . 10 | Page  \n The game is designed with the four missions of increasing complexity to teach players \ngradually. These missions teach players different techniques for identifying safe food \nand water, such as recognizing plant characteristics and performing irritation test ing. \nIn the material collection stage, the researchers collected images, 3D objects with \ntextures, 3D characters, audio and animations needed for the game. Most 3D assets \nwere obtained from Unity Assets store, and any necessary modifications were made \nusing Blender. The assembly stage involved the actual game development using the \nunity game engine and visual studio as a source code editor  (Kurniawan, et al., 2023) . \nIn the testing phase, the game’s compatibility is determined. The effect of the game \non the players understanding of identifying the safe food and water is evaluated using \na pre -test and post -test methodology. The results indicate a significant increase in  \nknowledge after playing the game  (Kurniawan, et al., 2023) . \nIn conclusion, this research demonstrates the survival simulation game as a useful \nteaching tool for learning how to locate safe food and water sources in the Borneo \nForest. Future research should explore the practical application of this knowledge, \ncompar e the game with traditional verbal instruction, and assess other learning \noutcomes such as motivation. Lastly, survival simulation games have the potential to \nprovide a useful and entertaining method for teaching the survival skills  (Kurniawan, \net al., 2023) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 11 | Page  \n 13.2 Opening the World of Contextually specific player experiences.  \nThe study of player experiences in games has developed, showing the variety of \nplayer enjoyment and gaming experiences. However, current research usually treats \ngames as standard entities or only looks at features in loneliness leaving little space \nfor the  unique characteristics of various gaming experiences. To fill this gap, the paper \npromotes a "contextually specific" approach that explores the distinctive features of \nvarious gaming experiences, concentrating on open world games that are known for \ngiving  players an unmatched level of freedom and choice  (Hughes & Cairns, 2021) . \nIn order to connect game features with player experiences, game genres provide a \nlinking framework. This enables researchers to look at why players are drawn to \nparticular genres, like MMOs. The basic elements that contribute to the overall player \nexperien ce are not enough covered by this genre -focused approach. Instead of \nexploring into the details of these experiences, it frequently focuses on how game \nfeatures contribute to them  (Hughes & Cairns, 2021) . \nOpen world games offer a unique perspective on the difference between what players \nare supposed to experience and the entirety of a game. These games give players the \nfreedom to pursue different interests without imposing a predetermined course of \naction, which leads to highly personalized gameplay. Curren t theories find it hard to \nexplain these various player behaviors  (Hughes & Cairns, 2021) . \nHowever, the highly personalized nature of player experiences in open world games \nbegs the question of whether there are any universals that can be observed. \nAdditionally, players, designers, and researchers do not all agree on what constitutes \na "open wor ld" game, which makes it more difficult to comprehend the open world \ngaming experience. Regardless of these difficulties, open world games provide \ninsightful analyses of context -specific gaming experiences, could be shedding light on \nelements that players find interesting and enjoyable  (Hughes & Cairns, 2021) . \nThe main objective of this study is to investigate how the open world gamers view their \nexperience and to recognize its unique features when compared to other gaming \ncategories. To understand how these games shares the similar experiences and to \nidentify t he features that defines the open world concept, the researchers are looking \nfor the similarities. The study used a method based on the qualitative research with \nthe objective of achieving the saturation of data, which is the process of collecting the 12 | Page  \n data up until the responses start to repeat themselves and stop adding to the study’s \ntheoretical themes  (Hughes & Cairns, 2021) . \nIn the open world games, player have the freedom to engage and disengage with the \ntasks as they see fit, without any restrictions. Due to this flexibility, players can stay \nengaged with the game which avoid from getting bored. They also have the option to \nself-pace their gaming experience by deciding whether they want to follow the main \nstoryline or pursue the other activities of interest. The players can change to other \ntasks withing the game if one becomes too difficult or emotionally stressful. For \nexamp le, players set a high value on this control over their gaming experience \nbecause it gives them the freedom to select their preferred activities and levels of \nintensity for each gaming session  (Hughes & Cairns, 2021) . \nThe ability to explore the virtual game world freely is a crucial aspect of the open world \ngames. Players enjoy having the option to explore while working towards the main \ngoal. The game’s settings must be interesting enough to draw the players in even as \nthey are concentrating on the main goal. One of the most important aspects of the \nopen world game design is the stress between the appeal of the main objective and \nthe attractiveness of the surrounding world. Players want a compelling story that gives \nthem  the opportunity to explore and discover the other interesting material  (Hughes & \nCairns, 2021) . \nOverall, open world games are designed to offer players the freedom to select their \ntasks and controls the speed of their gaming experiences. One of the key components \nof this experience is the freedom to roam around the virtual game world and interact \nwith the various content besides the primary objective of the game. These factors work \ntogether to enable players to self -pace their gaming adventures in the open world \ngames. The players freedom and world design both of them play the crucial roles in \nthis co ntext  (Hughes & Cairns, 2021) . \nIn Conclusion, this paper suggests a unique way to understand how the players feel \nwhen they play the open -world games. They talked to the players and looked at what \nthey said to find out what makes an open world game more special. Even though open \nworld g ames are very different for the different players, this method helps us learn \nmore about what the players like in these games. Lastly, it also helps us to understand 13 | Page  \n why players enjoy the open world games and opening the door for more research \nabout the gaming experiences  (Hughes & Cairns, 2021) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 | Page  \n 13.3 A descriptive -analytical study of the Open -World Game Design \n“Grand Theft Auto V and online version” with an emphasis on Role -\nPlaying Capabilities  \nThis research explores how the “open world” is used in the digital games, focusing on \nthe popular game “Grand Theft Auto V”. It looks into how open -world games are non -\nlinear, whether cultural elements are present, and how artificial intelligence is used.  \nThe study conducts a critical analysis of the game\'s structure, design, and player -\naccessible paths to goal -accomplishing. It emphasizes how, despite how different \nprofessions and jobs are portrayed in the game, involvement in illegal activities like \ndrug dealing, organized robberies, and mafia involvement are frequently the key to \nsuccess, while playing the role of a police officer is difficult  (Ameli & Haghshenas, \n2023) . \nIt discusses the emergence and popularity of the GTA series, with the fifth edition \nreleased in 2013 breaking sales records . The game is described as an open -world \nadventure game set in fictional cities modeled after real -life American cities . GTA has \nreceived high ratings from game rating databases despite complaints about violence \nand cultural stereotypes.  The research\'s main question is whether GTA\'s open world \nreally gives players the freedom to select their roles, way of life, and missions, or if \nthere are preferred pathways built into the game that steer players toward risky and \nillegal activities.  Additionally, the study investigates whether the game’s design, \nstoryline and the rewards limit player’s choices and success possibilities  (Ameli & \nHaghshenas, 2023) . \nThis study\'s methodology focuses on using the case study method, a typical qualitative \nresearch strategy, to gain a thorough understanding of the open -world phenomenon \nin computer games, with a special focus on the Grand Theft Auto  (GTA)  game . Case \nstudy research involves an in -depth examination of a specific instance or case that \nhas been specifically selected to fulfill one of three main objectives : \na. Providing a complete and accurate description of the phenomenon.  \nb. Developing potential explanations for it.  \nc. Evaluating the phenomenon  (Ameli & Haghshenas, 2023) . \n 15 | Page  \n An objective of a case study is to present a thorough and in -depth analysis of the \nphenomenon, capturing its essence in its natural setting and relating it to important \nthemes and ideas.  The open world of video games, specifically GTA, has been looked \nat in this research using player observation as well as professional players analysis of \ngameplay videos . This approach allows for an examination of the game in its natural \nenvironment, with a focus on its design and open -world features  (Ameli & \nHaghshenas, 2023) . \nThe research shows that the GTA’s world is vast and richly detailed, giving players a \nton of chances to explore, grow, and learn.  The design of the game includes \ncomplicated textures and interactive elements that increase its appeal to players and \nsurprise them.  The game\'s primary goals, which include buying and selling stocks and \ncars, players can take part in a variety of other activities, such as boating , \nmotorcycling, cycling, racing cars, tennis, golf, wrist throwing, high jumping, and \nrunning.  Additio nally, the game offers entertaining features like animal hunting, \nenhancing the depth and variety of the overall gaming experience.  GTA has \nsuccessfully integrated these interesting components and grown to be a well -known \nand significant game in the digital gaming sector  (Ameli & Haghshenas, 2023) . \nIn video games, the idea of role-playing has always been present and has developed \nover time to become more comprehensive, unique, and interactive.  The integration of \nthe virtual world into this field has further inspired developers and resulted in important \ndevelopments.  Role-playing in online digital games improves immersion and \nencourages players to communicate meaningfully, authentically, and interactively. The \npopularity of live broadcasting platforms has increased the range of interaction, \ninvolving not only players a nd in -game characters but also spectators and game fans. \nThese features have helped games that simulate different facets of life to gain a large \nfollowing of fans and enthusiasts  (Ameli & Haghshenas, 2023) . \nGTA is regarded as a game that changed the digital gaming industry and signaled a \ncritical turning point in the development of video games.  Players can now enjoy a wide \nrange of activities and experiences in a world with rich textures and interactive \nelements.  Additionally, with its representation of ruthless law enforcement and thrilling \nchases, GTA stands out as a representative of contemporary gangster cinema in the \nworld of digital gaming. The Los Santos Police Department, which is based on a real 16 | Page  \n police station in Los Angeles known for its aggressive approach to fighting crime, is \none example of how the game\'s design incorporates elements inspired by real -life \nsettings  (Ameli & Haghshenas, 2023) . \nIn conclusion, the online version of Grand Theft Auto has developed to provide a rich \nand immersive experience that goes beyond standard gaming. Players can explore \ndifferent professions, interact with others, and immerse themselves in a virtual world \nwher e they can fulfill their ambitions, even if those ambitions involve working for the \ngovernment or a criminal organization. GTA is a standout example of how video \ngames continue to evolve and offer players with distinctive and engaging experiences \nbecause o f the game\'s emphasis on role -playing, interactivity, and real -life \nappearances  (Ameli & Haghshenas, 2023) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17 | Page  \n 13.4 Meaningful Place: A Phenomenological Approach to the Design of \nSpatial Experience in Open World Games  \nRecent years have seen a rise in the popularity of large, open virtual worlds, but this \nhas also brought about a significant challenge: despite their size, these game \nenvironments frequently feel uninteresting and meaningless. This paper suggests a \nnovel s trategy to deal with this problem by emphasizing the idea of "place" within \nvirtual worlds as opposed to seeing them as merely empty "spaces." With a wider \nperspective intended to prepare for the future of virtual reality, it introduces the concept \nof "ori entation -identification -time" as a straightforward yet effective way to infuse these \ngame worlds with excitement and meaning  (Wang, et al., 2023) . \nOpen -world video games have become extremely popular due to their vast and \ndetailed virtual environments. However, in these huge game worlds, players frequently \nstruggle with a sense of repetition and emptiness. This paper explores the field of \nphenomenolo gy, the study of how users interact with virtual worlds, in an effort to \ntackle this challenge head -on. The paper aims to improve the overall gaming \nexperience by gaining a deeper understanding of player perceptions and interactions \nwith these spaces  (Wang, et al., 2023) . \nTraditionally, stories found in games have been the focus of game studies. However, \nwith the development of technology and the complexity of virtual worlds, people\'s focus \nhas shifted to the settings in which these games take place. Researchers and players  \ntoday concentrate on two main strategies: one treats game spaces as real -world \narenas created for particular activities, while the other looks at how players interact \nwith and perceive these spaces. With a focus on player perception and emotional \nengageme nt with the gaming environment, this essay takes the latter approach  \n(Wang, et al., 2023) . \nIt\'s important to distinguish between "space ontology" and "spatial experience" in order \nto find meaning in game worlds. The former sees game worlds as real -world locations \nfor particular pursuits, much like a playground made for games like tag or hide -and-\nseek. The latter perspective, known as "spatial experience," on the other hand, \nemphasizes how users interact with the entire virtual playground. The "spatial \nexperience" approach is the main focus of this essay, which aims to understand what \nmakes virtua l worlds interesting and alive outside of gaming  (Wang, et al., 2023) . 18 | Page  \n Looking for meaning in game environments leads to a crucial separation between \n"space" and "place." Imagine yourself in a large, open field, a place that might seem \nlifeless and uninteresting. In contrast, a "place" brings  up richer associations, \ncomparable to a warm bedroom or a beloved park that conjures up strong feelings and \nmemories. The paper makes the case that people need this sense of place in virtual \nsettings. It involves connecting with the virtual world as well as following the rules. \nEven in va st open -world environments, game designers are urged to put a priority on \ncreating meaningful "place" experiences  (Wang, et al., 2023) . \nIn Conclusion, this paper concludes that the three -dimensional concept known as \n"orientation -identification -time" should be adopted. This strategy involves helping \nplayers in understanding their position, goal, and the passage of time within the game\'s \nvirtual world. The  paper makes the claim that by doing this, it is possible to change \nuninteresting game environments into engaging ones. The paper also mentions the \nidea of the "Metaverse," a sizable virtual world where people may spend a lot of time \nin the future. It points out the potential problems that might develop if virtual worlds \nlack purpose and exhorts game developers and virtual reality developers to \nconcentrate on creating meaningful "place" experiences  (Wang, et al., 2023) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19 | Page  \n 14.

Literature Review  \r\n4.1. Ad Prediction using Click Through Rate and Machine Learning with  \r\nReinforcement  \r\nThis conference paper  written by (Lakshmanarao, et al., 2021)  focuses on Upper \r\nConfidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, represent ing significant stride in \r\nonline advertising optimization. It addresses  the steps of dataset collection, utilizing the \r\nAds_CTR_Optimizsation dataset from Kaggle, consisting of information on 10 \r\nadvertisements and 10,000 user clicks. The exploration of the dataset reveals a binary \r\nnature (0 and 1) representing user clicks on a dvertisements, forming the basics for the \r\nreinforcement learning models. Introduction of reinforcement learning as a field within \r\nmachine learning sets the stage for the subsequent application of UCB and Thomspon \r\nSampling. Reinforcement learning, with its focus on maximizing rewards, is appropriately \r\nframed within the context of online  advertising, where the algorithm learns from its \r\nexperiences rather than relying on predefined answers. The methodology  section \r\nelaborates the use of UCB algorithm and the Thompson Samling algorithm.  UCB \r\nalgorithm involves calculating average rewards and confidence intervals for each \r\nadvertisement, while Thompson Sampling relies on randomly generated beliefs to select \r\nads. The experimentation phase, spanning 1000 rounds, highl ights the efficiency of the \r\nalgorithms. Random Selection surprisingly identifies Ad -9 as the best -performing ad  \r\namong the 10 ads , laying the foundation for comparison with the more sophisticated UCB \r\nand Thompson Samling algorithms. UCB, when applied for different rounds, exhibits \r\nvarying performances, with Ad -5 and Ad -8 emerging as top -performing ads in different \r\nscenarios. Thompso n Sampling consistently prioritizes Ad -5 across all rounds, \r\noutperforming UCB in predictive accuracy.  Potential challenges relat ed to algorithm \r\nsensitivity, assumption of stationarity in user behavior, and the impact of feature \r\nrepresentation  could be some  of the limitations . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n4 \r\n 4.2. Ad Click Prediction in Sequence with Long Short -Term Memory \r\nNetworks: An Eternality -aware Model  \r\nThis paper addresses  the problem related to click -through  rate (CTR) in sponsored ads, \r\nwhere the data for accuracy of the click prediction impacts the user search experience \r\nand business revenue  significantly . The proposed approach / methodology utilizes \r\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) cells for \r\nsequential click prediction. The LSTM -RNN architecture is detailed, involving the \r\nsequential feeding of ads from ML1 to ML4,  where ML1 is the first  ad displayed in \r\nmainline, conside ring the information from previous ads. Authors have conducted  \r\nanalysis of externalities, demonstrating the impact of the CTR of the first ad (ML1) on the \r\nCTR of the second ad (ML2). The  final performance of the proposed  model  above is \r\nevaluated with the help of  standard metrics such as AUC Curve  and Relative Information \r\nGain (RIG), showcasing the improvements over a baseline Deep Neural Network (DNN) \r\nmodel. Acknowledg ing certain  challenges , the primary concern covered is the high \r\ncomputational cost associated with the LSTM -RNN model, which may hinder its real -time \r\napplicability in dynamic advertising environments. To address this, a simplified version is \r\nproposed, reducing computation costs while maintaining a substanti al portion of the \r\naccuracy gains. The analys is of externalities reveals that the quality of the first ad impacts \r\nthe CTR of subsequent ads, establishing the influence of ad quality on sequential CTR. \r\nThe LSTM -RNN model outperforms the baseline DNN model, demonstrating \r\nimprovements in AUC and RIG acr oss various ad positions. To address computation cost, \r\na simplified version with a new externality feature is proposed, achieving significant gains \r\nwith reduced complexity  (Deng, et al., 2018) . \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n5 \r\n 4.3. Deep User Segment Interest Network Modeling for Click -Through  \r\nRate Prediction of Online Advertising  \r\nThe model architecture uses Deep User Segment Interest Network (DUSIN) model to \r\ncomprise key layers, including an Embedding Layer transforming user behavior \r\nsequences, an Individual Interest Extractor Layer utilizing a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) \r\nfor extracting individual user interests, a Segment Interest Activating Layer updating \r\nsegme nt interests based on the last hidden vector, and a Segment Interest Activating \r\nLayer inspired by Deep Interest Network (DIN). Employing  the Tobacco dataset, \r\nresearchers unde rtake  preprocessing steps like under sampling for class imbalance and  \r\ndefine  user segments based on features related to age and gender.  Baseline algorithms \r\nsuch as MLP, PNN, DeepFM and DIN are compared using evaluation metrics like AUC \r\nand log loss.  Insights from segment interest are gained by visualizing differences using \r\nEuclidean distances, providing valuable perspectives on user preferences within the \r\npredefined segments. The model performance comparison demonstrates the superiority \r\nof DUSIN, with  notable AUC gains over baseline models. Specifically, DUSIN achieved \r\nan AUC gain of 0.0017 over MLP and with a sequence length of 100, a  further gain of \r\n0.0029  is noticed . The analysis of different behavior sequence lengths emphasizes the \r\nsignificance of historical user behavior, indicating optimal performance with longer \r\nsequence for DUSIN. The findings offer valuable insights into user segment dynamics, \r\nemphasizing the p ractical relevance of DUSIN in real -time advertising systems. The \r\nability of model to outperform baseline algorithms underscores its potential for enhancing \r\nCTR prediction accuracy. The consideration of different behavior sequ ence lengths \r\nprovides nuanced perspectives on the temporal aspects of user behavior. It also \r\nacknowledges certain limitations, including the reliance on predefined user segments and \r\nthe potential of dataset high dimensional spare features (Kim, et al., 2021) . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n6 \r\n 4.4. Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning  \r\nThe research performed by (Patel, et al., 2020)  focused on customer segmentation  \r\nintroduces diverse methodologies of clustering models, including the widely utilized K -\r\nmeans algorithm known for its computational efficiency, the hierarchical clustering \r\napproach that builds a hierarchy of data points, the density -based clustering repres ented \r\nby DBSCAN, and the Affinity Propagation Algorithm, which stands out for its ability to \r\nidentify clusters without a predefined number.  The methodology underscores the \r\nsignificance of CRM in modern marketing, emphasizin g its role in customer value analysis \r\nand the development of persistent  customer -company relationships. Customer \r\nsegmentation emerges as a crucial aspect, involving the division into distinct buyers  of \r\nsimilar  behaviors and characteristics. The use of clustering algorithms becomes evident \r\nas a powerful tool in predicting consumption trends and refining marketing strategies. The \r\ncomparative analysis of these clustering algorithms reveals valuable insights into t heir \r\nperformance across dimensions such as comp utation speed, adaptability to dataset \r\ncharacteristics, and overall efficiency. K -Means, for instance, exhibits high computational \r\nefficiency. K -Means, exhibits high computational efficiency bur grapples with the \r\nchallenge of dependency on the initial numb er of clusters. Hierarchical clustering, \r\nalthough versatile in cluster formation, faces limitations in computational speed, making \r\nit more suitable for smaller datasets . The finding shows the importance of choosing the \r\nappropriate clustering algorithm base d on specific dataset characteristics and analytical \r\ngoals. Moreover, it acknowledges the limitations associated with interpreting cluster \r\nmeanings and suggests a potential enhancement by addressing these challenges . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n7 \r\n 4.5. Analysis of Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for  an \r\nEfficient Customer Segmentation using Clustering Ensemble and \r\nSpectral Clustering  \r\nAn insightful analysis by the models employed for unsupervised machine learning \r\ntechniques include Mini Batch K -Means, DBSCAN, K -Means, Mean Shift, and Spectral \r\nClustering. Data is extracted , collected  from Moroccan resident s, resulting in a dataset of \r\n1357 individuals with eight distinguishing  freatures . The methodology involves applying \r\nindividual clustering models to the dataset and combining their results using clustering \r\nensemble and spectral clustering. The proposed model is then applied to a real dat aset, \r\nshowcasing its effectiveness in clustering diverse populations. Performance evaluation  \r\nusing metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), \r\nSilhouette Coefficient (SC), and Davies -Bouldin Index (DI), demonstrating the superiority \r\nof model over old method of  clustering approaches is performed . The findings showcase  \r\nthe distinct clusters based on demographics and socioeconomic attributes. Cluster 3 \r\ncomprises educated, high income, non -single females in large cities, whil e Cluster 4 \r\nconsists of single men with higher incomes in urban centers. Median age comparisons \r\nhighlight variations across clusters, with Cluster 2 and 3 showing younger ages (28.5 and \r\n29), and Clusters 1 and 4 exhibiting notably older ages (36 and 37). A pplication to a real \r\ndataset identifies five clusters, with Cluster 0 representing middle class single men and \r\nCluster 4 comprising married women with high income and education. The proposed \r\nmodel outperforms traditional models in performance metrics, with  ARI, NMI, SC, and DI \r\nvalues of 0.7014, 0.7175, 0.7289, and 0.7515, respectively, indicating its efficacy in \r\ncapturing complex patterns within datasets.  However, the study has limitations. It primarily \r\nrelies on traditional clustering models, g eneralizing may be limited to the specific \r\ncharacteristics of the Moroccan residents surveyed  (Karim & Hicham, 2022) .  \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n8 \r\n 4.6. K-Means and K -Medoids Clustering Methods for Customer  \r\nSegmentation in Online Retail Datasets  \r\nIn this research  conducted by (Mufarroha, et al., 2022) , gives  light on the application of \r\nK-Means and K -Medoids clustering methods for customer segmentation in  the online \r\nretail datasets. The research employed a methodology encompassing various stages. \r\nData collection involved the utilization of online retail customer data obtained from Kaggle, \r\ncomprising parameters such as invoice, stock code, description, invoice data, price, \r\ncustomer ID, and country. The subsequent data preprocessing steps included handling \r\nmissing values, conducting regency, frequency, and  monetary (RFM) analysis, \r\naddressing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR), and normalizing the data. The \r\nclustering methods applied were K -Means and K -Medoids, each requiring the \r\ndetermination of the optimal number of cluster (K). The elbow method was employed for \r\nthis purpose. For K -Means, the study identified the optimal K value as 4, resulting in four \r\ndistinct clusters with specific characteristics related to customer behavior. K -Medoids, \r\nwith an optimal K value of 6, formed six clusters, offerin g a more detailed segmentation \r\nbased on RFM analysis . The results analysis involved an examination and interpretation \r\nof the characteristics of each cluster obtained from both clustering methods. Making the \r\nimportance of preprocessing steps and  highlighting the implications for businesses in \r\ntailoring their strategies based on the identified customer clusters , findings  are explained \r\nproperly . The generalization of the findings maybe be constrained due to the specific \r\ncharacteristics of the dataset and  focus  on clustering techniques neglects the exploration \r\nof other potential factors influencing customer behavior. The reliance on the elbow \r\nmethod for finding  the most favorable  number of clusters may not be universally \r\napplicable, and analysis with alternative clustering algorithms is absent . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n9 \r\n 4.7. AdRobot: A Smart Segmentation Application for Automated & \r\nPersonalized Marketing Campaigns  \r\nThis paper addresses a critical challenge in contemporary marketing connecting the right \r\npromotional campaign with the right audience in the digital area. The authors present \r\nAdRobot as a solution, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to automat e and \r\npersonalize the marketing strategies. The proposed algorithm investigates profiling and \r\nconversational data, employing AI heuristics to adeptly match audiences with tailored \r\npromotional campaigns. The methodology comprises two key data collection app roaches. \r\nFirstly, conversational constraints are automatically gathered from interactions with the \r\nChatfuel chatbot, encompassing  details such as age, field of work, marital  status, and \r\ninterests. Secondly, customer responses to marketing agent posts on social media \r\nplatforms, including likes, dislikes, ratings, and comments, are collected.  Distance \r\ncorrelation, Levenshtein distance, and Euclidean distance to match customers with the \r\nmost suitable  promotional campaigns based on characteristics like departur e place, \r\narrival place, departure date, ticket type and price  are utilization for the research . The \r\nintegration of Chatfuel ch atbot and DialogFlow is pivotal to the process. Chatfuel \r\nfacilitates user interactions, while DialogFlow contributes to natural language \r\nunderstanding, aiding in the determination of customer intents during conversations. The \r\noverall process involves the i nitiation of conversation, data collection through forms or \r\npredefined questions, and the generation of targets for customized adv ertising \r\ncampaigns . The results showcase the effectiveness of the algorithm, with a positive user \r\nresponse indicating a 70% satisfaction rate regarding the accuracy of matched offers. \r\nHowever, the paper acknowledges certain limitations. Notably, the reliance on data \r\nexclusive ly from Facebook interactions raises concerns about the generalization of \r\nfindings across diverse social media platforms. The researchers have  primarily focuse d \r\non a specific industry potentially limiting its applicability to other doma ins (Hafaiedh, et \r\nal., 2020) . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n10 \r\n 5. Findings  \r\nThe research and analysis of papers on ad prediction showcases the effectiveness of \r\nadvanced techniques such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Thompson Sampling, and \r\nLSTM in enhancing predictive accuracy. The comparison of UCB and Thompson \r\nSampling demonstr ates different performances. The LSTM -RNN model, while \r\noutperforming baseline models, faces challenges related to computational costs. Similarly \r\nfor customer segmentation, the clustering algorithms such as K -Means, K -Medoids, and \r\nSpectral Clustering provid es valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each \r\nalgorithm, emphasizing the importance of choosing the appropriate method based on \r\ndataset characteristics and analytical goals.  Deep User Segment Interest Network \r\n(DUSIN) showcased promising result for click through rate prediction. The papers analyze \r\nthe impact of AI in post -performance, campaign effectiveness, and optimization of ad \r\nspending. An example shown for AdRobot uses AI for automating promotional campaigns \r\nbased on customer profiles a nd interactions. The study has certain limitations such as \r\nalgorithm sensitivity, assumptions about user behavior, and potential biases in data \r\ncollection.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n11 \r\n 6. Conclusion  \r\nThe analysis of papers strides in the application of AI in advertising and customer \r\nsegmentation. With the use of reinforcement learning algorithms to the insights gained \r\nthrough clustering techniques implication in a system that can first track the custom er \r\nactivity and based on the performance of the customer activity segregate them offering \r\nthe businesses valuable insights for enhancing the marketing strategies based on \r\ncustomer behavior. I t provides valuable insights into the practical application of \r\nreinforcement learning for ad prediction . This innovation emerges as a solution for \r\nautomated and personalized marketing campaigns, leveraging AI and advanced \r\nalgorithms to enhance audience targeting. However, there is a need for real -world cases  \r\nto illustrate the practical application of clustering algorithms in diverse business scenarios, \r\nbridging the gap between theoretical insights and practical implications.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n   6CS014  \r\n12 \r\n 7.

The shop, known as "Timeless Treasures," was run by an enigmatic old man named Elijah Gray. Elijah was rumored to have lived for centuries, and many believed he possessed magical powers that allowed him to collect items from different eras.\r\n\r\nOne day, a curious young woman named Amelia wandered into Timeless Treasures. She was drawn to an ornate mirror that seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly glow. As she gazed into it, the reflection revealed not her own face but a bustling Victorian-era market.\r\n\r\nIntrigued and slightly frightened, Amelia sought out Elijah for an explanation. With a twinkle in his eye, he revealed the mirror\'s secret. It was a portal to the past, allowing glimpses into different moments in history. Amelia, captivated by the idea of exploring the past, persuaded Elijah to teach her how to control the mirror\'s magic.\r\n\r\nUnder Elijah\'s guidance, Amelia discovered she could step through the portal and experience the wonders of bygone eras. Each time she entered, she found herself in a new and exciting adventure. From the roaring twenties to ancient civilizations, Amelia marveled at the diversity of human history.\r\n\r\nHowever, with great power came great responsibility. Elijah warned Amelia of the dangers of altering the course of history. Every action in the past could have unforeseen consequences in the present. Despite the warnings, Amelia couldn\'t resist the temptation to intervene in certain historical events to make the world a better place.\r\n\r\nOne day, while exploring ancient Egypt, Amelia encountered a young pharaoh named Akhenaten. Feeling a connection, she decided to warn him of the impending rebellion against his rule. Unbeknownst to her, this decision set off a chain of events that altered the course of history, creating a ripple effect that changed the present.\r\n\r\nReturning to Eldoria, Amelia was shocked to find a world that was unrecognizable. The consequences of her actions had led to a modern society with vastly different technology, politics, and culture. Desperate to undo the damage, she sought out Elijah for help.\r\n\r\nElijah, with a solemn expression, explained that time was a delicate tapestry, and once threads were altered, they couldn\'t be easily rewoven. Together, they devised a plan to restore balance by carefully undoing the changes Amelia had made.\r\n\r\nAs they journeyed through the altered timelines, facing challenges and overcoming obstacles, Amelia learned the importance of respecting the flow of time. In the end, they managed to mend the tapestry, and Eldoria returned to its familiar state.\r\n\r\nGrateful for the lessons learned, Amelia bid farewell to Elijah and the magical mirror. She returned to her own time, carrying with her the wisdom of the ages and a newfound appreciation for the fragility of history.

Each task should be zipped up into a single zip \r\nfolder containing all C/CUDA and resource files for the submission on Canvas.  \r\n1. Password cracking using multithreading  (15% - 100 marks)  \r\nIn this task, you will be asked to use the “crypt” library to decrypt a password using \r\nmultithreading. You will be provided with two programs. The first program called \r\n“EncryptSHA512.c”  which  allows you to encrypt a password. For this assessment , you will be \r\nrequired to decrypt a 4-character  password consisting of 2 capital  letters, and 2 numbers. The \r\nformat of the password should be “LetterLetterNumberNumber.” For example, “HP93.” Once \r\nyou have generated your password, this should then be entered into your program to decrypt \r\nthe password.  The method of input for the encrypted password is up to you.  The second \r\nprogram is a  skeleton code to crack the password in regular C without any multithread ing \r\nsyntax. Your task is to use multithreading  to split the workload over many threads  and find the \r\npassword. Once the password has been found, the program should finish meaning not all \r\ncombinations of 2 letters and 2 numbers should be explored unless it’s  ZZ99 and the last thread \r\nhappens to finish last.  \r\nCracks a p assword using multithreading and dynamic slicing based on thread count (75  marks)  \r\nProgram finishes appropriately when password has been found (25  marks)  \r\n  \r\n2. Matrix Multiplication using multithreadi ng (25% - 100 marks)  \r\nYou will create a matrix multiplication program which uses multithreading. Matrices are often \r\ntwo-dimensional arrays varying in sizes, for your application, you will only need to multiply two -\r\ndimensional ones. Your program will read in  the matrices from a supplied file (txt), store them \r\nappropriately using dynamic memory allocation features and multiply them by splitting the tasks \r\nacross “n” threads (any amount of threads). You should use command line arguments to specify \r\nwhich file to read from (argv[1]) and the number of threads to use (argv[2]). If the number of \r\nthreads requested by the user is greater than the biggest dimension of the matrices to be \r\nmultiplied, the actual number of threads used in the calculation should be limited to  the \r\nmaximum dimension of the matrices. Your program should be able to take “any” size matrices \r\nand multiply them depending on the data found within the file. Some sizes of matrices cannot be \r\nmultiplied together, for example, if Matrix A is 3x3 and Matrix B is 2x2, you cannot multiply \r\nthem. If Matrix A is 2x3 and Matrix B is 3x2, then this can be multiplied. You will need to \r\nresearch how to multiply matrices, this will also be covered in the lectures (briefly). If the \r\nmatrices cannot be multiplied, your pro gram should output an error message notifying the user \r\nand move on to the next pair of matrices. Your program should store the results of your \r\nsuccessful matrix multiplications in a text file – for every 2 matrices, there should be one \r\nresulting matrix. As  a minimum, you are expected to use the standard C file handling functions: \r\nfopen(), fclose(), fscanf(), and fprintf(), to read and to write your files. stdin and stdout \r\nredirection will not be acceptable.  \r\nRead data from file appropriately ( 20 marks)  \r\nUsin g dynamic memory (malloc) for matrix A and matrix B (10 marks)  \r\nCreating an algorithm to multiply matrices correctly (20 marks)  \r\nUsing multithreading with equal computations (30 marks)  \r\nStoring the correct output matrices in the correct format to a file (20 marks)  \r\n \r\n3. Password Cracking using CUDA  (30% - 100 marks)  \r\nUsing a similar concept as question 2, you will now crack passwords using CUDA. As a kernel \r\nfunction cannot use the crypt library, you will be given an encryption function instead which will \r\ngenera te a password for you.  Your program will take in an encrypted password and decrypt it \r\nusing many threads on the GPU. CUDA allows multidimensional thread configurations so your \r\nkernel function (which runs on the GPU) will need to be modified according to h ow you call your \r\nfunction.  \r\nGenerate encrypted password  in the kernel function (using CudaCrypt function)  to be \r\ncompared to original encrypted password (25  marks)  \r\nAllocating the correct amount of memory on the GPU based on input data. Memory is freed \r\nonce used (15  marks)  \r\nProgram works with multiple blocks and threads  – the number of blocks and threads will \r\ndepend on your kernel function. You will not be penalised if your program only works with a set number of blocks and threads however, your program must u se more than one block (axis \r\nis up to you) and more than one thread (axis is up to you)  (40 marks)  \r\nDecrypted password sent back to the CPU and printed  (20 marks)  \r\n \r\n4. Box Blur using CUDA (30% - 100 marks)   \r\nYour program will decode a PNG file into an array and apply the box blur filter. Blurring an image \r\nreduces noise by taking the average RGB values around a specific pixel and setting its RGB to the \r\nmean values you’ve just calculated. This smoothens the colour across a matrix of pixels. For this \r\nassessment, you will use a 3 x3 matrix. For example, if you have a 5x5 image such as the \r\nfollowing (be aware that the coordinate values will depend on how you format your 2D array):  \r\n \r\n0,4 1,4 2,4 3,4 4,4 \r\n0,3 1,3 2,3 3,3 4,3 \r\n0,2 1,2 2,2 3,2 4,2 \r\n0,1 1,1 2,1 3,1 4,1 \r\n0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0 4,0 \r\n \r\nThe shaded region above represents the pixel we want to blur, in this case, we are focusing on \r\npixel 1,2  (x,y) (Centre of the matrix). T o apply the blur for this pixel, you would sum all the Red \r\nvalues from the surrounding coordinates including 1,2 (total of 9 R values) and find the average \r\n(divide by 9). This is now the new Red value for coordinate 1,2. You must then repeat this for \r\nGreen and Blue values. This must be repeated throughout the ima ge. If you are working on a \r\npixel which is not fully surrounded by pixels (8 pixels), you must take the average of however \r\nmany neighbouring pixels there are.  \r\n \r\nYour task is to use CUDA to blur an image. Your number of blocks and threads should in an ideal  \r\nscenario reflect the dimension of the image however, there are limits to the amount of blocks \r\nand threads you can spawn in each dimension (regarding block and thread dimensions (x,y,z). \r\nYou will not be penalised if you do not use different dimensions of b locks and threads, for this \r\nassessment, we will accept just one dimensional blocks and threads, e.g. \r\nfunction<<<blockNumber, threadNumber>>>  \r\n \r\nReading in an image fi le into a single or 2D array (5  marks)  \r\nAllocating the correct amount of memory on the GPU ba sed on input data. Memory is freed \r\nonce used (15  marks)  \r\nApplying Box filter on image  in the kernel function  (30 marks)  \r\nReturn blurred image data from the GPU to the CPU (30 marks)  \r\nOutputting the correct image with Box Blur applied  as a file  (20 marks)  \r\n \r\n  Important Message  \r\n \r\nYou may be asked to clarify your assessment after moderation has taken place. This is to ensure the \r\nwork has been completed by the student . \r\n \r\nYou must achieve 40 percent overall to pass this module. There will be a resit opportunity during \r\nresit week (July) to achieve a pass.  \r\n \r\nSubmission of work  \r\nYour completed work for assignments must be handed in on or before the due date. You must keep \r\na copy or backup of any assessed work that you submit.  Failure to do so may result in your having \r\nto repeat that piece of work.  \r\n \r\nPenalties for late submission of coursework  \r\nStandard Faculty of Science and Technology arrangements apply.  \r\nANY late submission (without valid cause) will result in 0 marks being allocated  to the coursework . \r\n \r\nProcedure for requesting extensions  \r\nIf you have a valid reason for requiring an extension you must request an extension using e:vision. \r\nRequests for extension to assignment deadlines should normally be submitted  before the \r\nsubmission deadline and may be granted for a maximum of seven days (one calendar week).  \r\n  \r\nRetrieval of Failur e \r\nA pass of 40% or above must be obtained overall for the module (but not necessarily in each \r\nassessment task).  \r\nWhere a student fails a module they have the right to attempt the failed assessment(s) once, at \r\nthe next resit opportunity (normally July resit  period).   If a student fails assessment for a second \r\ntime they have a right to repeat (i.e. RETAKE) the module.  \r\n \r\nNOTE:  STUDENTS  WHO  DO NOT  TAKE  THEIR  RESIT  AT THE  NEXT  AVAILABLE  RESIT  OPPORTUNITY  \r\nWILL  BE REQUIRED  TO REPEAT  THE  MODULE .  \r\n \r\nMitigating Circumstances (also called Extenuating Circumstances).  \r\nIf you are unable to meet a deadline or attend an examination, and you have a valid reason, then \r\nyou will need to request via e:vision Extenuating Circumstances.   \r\n \r\nFeedback of assignments  \r\nYou will be given feedback when you demonstrate your work.  \r\n \r\nYou normally have two working weeks from the date you receive your grade and feedback to \r\ncontact and discuss the matter with your lecturer. See the Student’s Union advice page \r\nhttp://www.wolvesunion.org/adviceandsupport/  for more details.  \r\nRegistration  \r\nPlease ensure that you are registered on the module. You can check your module registrations via \r\ne:Vision You should see your personal tutor or the Student Support Officer if you are unsure about \r\nyour programme of study. The fact that you are attending mod ule classes does not mean that you \r\nare necessarily registered. A grade may not be given if you are not registered.  \r\n Cheating  \r\nCheating is any attempt to gain unfair advantage by dishonest means and includes plagiarism  and \r\ncollusion.  Cheating is a serious of fence. You are advised to check the nature of each assessment. You \r\nmust work individually unless it is a group assessment.  \r\n \r\nCheating  is defined as any attempt by a candidate to gain unfair advantage in an assessment by \r\ndishonest means, and includes e.g . all breaches of examination room rules, impersonating another \r\ncandidate, falsifying data, and obtaining an examination paper in advance of its authorised release.  \r\n \r\nPlagiarism  is defined as incorporating a significant amount of un -attributed direct quotati on from, or \r\nun-attributed substantial paraphrasing of, the work of another.  \r\n \r\nCollusion occurs when two or more students collaborate to produce a piece of work to be submitted \r\n(in whole or part) for assessment and the work is presented as the work of one st udent alone.

Literature Review  \n4.1. Ad Prediction using Click Through Rate and Machine Learning with  \nReinforcement  \nThis conference paper  written by (Lakshmanarao, et al., 2021)  focuses on Upper \nConfidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, represent ing significant stride in \nonline advertising optimization. It addresses  the steps of dataset collection, utilizing the \nAds_CTR_Optimizsation dataset from Kaggle, consisting of information on 10 \nadvertisements and 10,000 user clicks. The exploration of the dataset reveals a binary \nnature (0 and 1) representing user clicks on a dvertisements, forming the basics for the \nreinforcement learning models. Introduction of reinforcement learning as a field within \nmachine learning sets the stage for the subsequent application of UCB and Thomspon \nSampling. Reinforcement learning, with its focus on maximizing rewards, is appropriately \nframed within the context of online  advertising, where the algorithm learns from its \nexperiences rather than relying on predefined answers. The methodology  section \nelaborates the use of UCB algorithm and the Thompson Samling algorithm.  UCB \nalgorithm involves calculating average rewards and confidence intervals for each \nadvertisement, while Thompson Sampling relies on randomly generated beliefs to select \nads. The experimentation phase, spanning 1000 rounds, highl ights the efficiency of the \nalgorithms. Random Selection surprisingly identifies Ad -9 as the best -performing ad  \namong the 10 ads , laying the foundation for comparison with the more sophisticated UCB \nand Thompson Samling algorithms. UCB, when applied for different rounds, exhibits \nvarying performances, with Ad -5 and Ad -8 emerging as top -performing ads in different \nscenarios. Thompso n Sampling consistently prioritizes Ad -5 across all rounds, \noutperforming UCB in predictive accuracy.  Potential challenges relat ed to algorithm \nsensitivity, assumption of stationarity in user behavior, and the impact of feature \nrepresentation  could be some  of the limitations . \n \n \n  6CS014  \n4 \n 4.2. Ad Click Prediction in Sequence with Long Short -Term Memory \nNetworks: An Eternality -aware Model  \nThis paper addresses  the problem related to click -through  rate (CTR) in sponsored ads, \nwhere the data for accuracy of the click prediction impacts the user search experience \nand business revenue  significantly . The proposed approach / methodology utilizes \nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) cells for \nsequential click prediction. The LSTM -RNN architecture is detailed, involving the \nsequential feeding of ads from ML1 to ML4,  where ML1 is the first  ad displayed in \nmainline, conside ring the information from previous ads. Authors have conducted  \nanalysis of externalities, demonstrating the impact of the CTR of the first ad (ML1) on the \nCTR of the second ad (ML2). The  final performance of the proposed  model  above is \nevaluated with the help of  standard metrics such as AUC Curve  and Relative Information \nGain (RIG), showcasing the improvements over a baseline Deep Neural Network (DNN) \nmodel. Acknowledg ing certain  challenges , the primary concern covered is the high \ncomputational cost associated with the LSTM -RNN model, which may hinder its real -time \napplicability in dynamic advertising environments. To address this, a simplified version is \nproposed, reducing computation costs while maintaining a substanti al portion of the \naccuracy gains. The analys is of externalities reveals that the quality of the first ad impacts \nthe CTR of subsequent ads, establishing the influence of ad quality on sequential CTR. \nThe LSTM -RNN model outperforms the baseline DNN model, demonstrating \nimprovements in AUC and RIG acr oss various ad positions. To address computation cost, \na simplified version with a new externality feature is proposed, achieving significant gains \nwith reduced complexity  (Deng, et al., 2018) . \n \n \n \n  6CS014  \n5 \n 4.3. Deep User Segment Interest Network Modeling for Click -Through  \nRate Prediction of Online Advertising  \nThe model architecture uses Deep User Segment Interest Network (DUSIN) model to \ncomprise key layers, including an Embedding Layer transforming user behavior \nsequences, an Individual Interest Extractor Layer utilizing a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) \nfor extracting individual user interests, a Segment Interest Activating Layer updating \nsegme nt interests based on the last hidden vector, and a Segment Interest Activating \nLayer inspired by Deep Interest Network (DIN). Employing  the Tobacco dataset, \nresearchers unde rtake  preprocessing steps like under sampling for class imbalance and  \ndefine  user segments based on features related to age and gender.  Baseline algorithms \nsuch as MLP, PNN, DeepFM and DIN are compared using evaluation metrics like AUC \nand log loss.  Insights from segment interest are gained by visualizing differences using \nEuclidean distances, providing valuable perspectives on user preferences within the \npredefined segments. The model performance comparison demonstrates the superiority \nof DUSIN, with  notable AUC gains over baseline models. Specifically, DUSIN achieved \nan AUC gain of 0.0017 over MLP and with a sequence length of 100, a  further gain of \n0.0029  is noticed . The analysis of different behavior sequence lengths emphasizes the \nsignificance of historical user behavior, indicating optimal performance with longer \nsequence for DUSIN. The findings offer valuable insights into user segment dynamics, \nemphasizing the p ractical relevance of DUSIN in real -time advertising systems. The \nability of model to outperform baseline algorithms underscores its potential for enhancing \nCTR prediction accuracy. The consideration of different behavior sequ ence lengths \nprovides nuanced perspectives on the temporal aspects of user behavior. It also \nacknowledges certain limitations, including the reliance on predefined user segments and \nthe potential of dataset high dimensional spare features (Kim, et al., 2021) . \n \n \n  6CS014  \n6 \n 4.4. Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning  \nThe research performed by (Patel, et al., 2020)  focused on customer segmentation  \nintroduces diverse methodologies of clustering models, including the widely utilized K -\nmeans algorithm known for its computational efficiency, the hierarchical clustering \napproach that builds a hierarchy of data points, the density -based clustering repres ented \nby DBSCAN, and the Affinity Propagation Algorithm, which stands out for its ability to \nidentify clusters without a predefined number.  The methodology underscores the \nsignificance of CRM in modern marketing, emphasizin g its role in customer value analysis \nand the development of persistent  customer -company relationships. Customer \nsegmentation emerges as a crucial aspect, involving the division into distinct buyers  of \nsimilar  behaviors and characteristics. The use of clustering algorithms becomes evident \nas a powerful tool in predicting consumption trends and refining marketing strategies. The \ncomparative analysis of these clustering algorithms reveals valuable insights into t heir \nperformance across dimensions such as comp utation speed, adaptability to dataset \ncharacteristics, and overall efficiency. K -Means, for instance, exhibits high computational \nefficiency. K -Means, exhibits high computational efficiency bur grapples with the \nchallenge of dependency on the initial numb er of clusters. Hierarchical clustering, \nalthough versatile in cluster formation, faces limitations in computational speed, making \nit more suitable for smaller datasets . The finding shows the importance of choosing the \nappropriate clustering algorithm base d on specific dataset characteristics and analytical \ngoals. Moreover, it acknowledges the limitations associated with interpreting cluster \nmeanings and suggests a potential enhancement by addressing these challenges . \n \n \n  6CS014  \n7 \n 4.5. Analysis of Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for  an \nEfficient Customer Segmentation using Clustering Ensemble and \nSpectral Clustering  \nAn insightful analysis by the models employed for unsupervised machine learning \ntechniques include Mini Batch K -Means, DBSCAN, K -Means, Mean Shift, and Spectral \nClustering. Data is extracted , collected  from Moroccan resident s, resulting in a dataset of \n1357 individuals with eight distinguishing  freatures . The methodology involves applying \nindividual clustering models to the dataset and combining their results using clustering \nensemble and spectral clustering. The proposed model is then applied to a real dat aset, \nshowcasing its effectiveness in clustering diverse populations. Performance evaluation  \nusing metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), \nSilhouette Coefficient (SC), and Davies -Bouldin Index (DI), demonstrating the superiority \nof model over old method of  clustering approaches is performed . The findings showcase  \nthe distinct clusters based on demographics and socioeconomic attributes. Cluster 3 \ncomprises educated, high income, non -single females in large cities, whil e Cluster 4 \nconsists of single men with higher incomes in urban centers. Median age comparisons \nhighlight variations across clusters, with Cluster 2 and 3 showing younger ages (28.5 and \n29), and Clusters 1 and 4 exhibiting notably older ages (36 and 37). A pplication to a real \ndataset identifies five clusters, with Cluster 0 representing middle class single men and \nCluster 4 comprising married women with high income and education. The proposed \nmodel outperforms traditional models in performance metrics, with  ARI, NMI, SC, and DI \nvalues of 0.7014, 0.7175, 0.7289, and 0.7515, respectively, indicating its efficacy in \ncapturing complex patterns within datasets.  However, the study has limitations. It primarily \nrelies on traditional clustering models, g eneralizing may be limited to the specific \ncharacteristics of the Moroccan residents surveyed  (Karim & Hicham, 2022) .  \n \n  6CS014  \n8 \n 4.6. K-Means and K -Medoids Clustering Methods for Customer  \nSegmentation in Online Retail Datasets  \nIn this research  conducted by (Mufarroha, et al., 2022) , gives  light on the application of \nK-Means and K -Medoids clustering methods for customer segmentation in  the online \nretail datasets. The research employed a methodology encompassing various stages. \nData collection involved the utilization of online retail customer data obtained from Kaggle, \ncomprising parameters such as invoice, stock code, description, invoice data, price, \ncustomer ID, and country. The subsequent data preprocessing steps included handling \nmissing values, conducting regency, frequency, and  monetary (RFM) analysis, \naddressing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR), and normalizing the data. The \nclustering methods applied were K -Means and K -Medoids, each requiring the \ndetermination of the optimal number of cluster (K). The elbow method was employed for \nthis purpose. For K -Means, the study identified the optimal K value as 4, resulting in four \ndistinct clusters with specific characteristics related to customer behavior. K -Medoids, \nwith an optimal K value of 6, formed six clusters, offerin g a more detailed segmentation \nbased on RFM analysis . The results analysis involved an examination and interpretation \nof the characteristics of each cluster obtained from both clustering methods. Making the \nimportance of preprocessing steps and  highlighting the implications for businesses in \ntailoring their strategies based on the identified customer clusters , findings  are explained \nproperly . The generalization of the findings maybe be constrained due to the specific \ncharacteristics of the dataset and  focus  on clustering techniques neglects the exploration \nof other potential factors influencing customer behavior. The reliance on the elbow \nmethod for finding  the most favorable  number of clusters may not be universally \napplicable, and analysis with alternative clustering algorithms is absent . \n \n \n  6CS014  \n9 \n 4.7. AdRobot: A Smart Segmentation Application for Automated & \nPersonalized Marketing Campaigns  \nThis paper addresses a critical challenge in contemporary marketing connecting the right \npromotional campaign with the right audience in the digital area. The authors present \nAdRobot as a solution, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to automat e and \npersonalize the marketing strategies. The proposed algorithm investigates profiling and \nconversational data, employing AI heuristics to adeptly match audiences with tailored \npromotional campaigns. The methodology comprises two key data collection app roaches. \nFirstly, conversational constraints are automatically gathered from interactions with the \nChatfuel chatbot, encompassing  details such as age, field of work, marital  status, and \ninterests. Secondly, customer responses to marketing agent posts on social media \nplatforms, including likes, dislikes, ratings, and comments, are collected.  Distance \ncorrelation, Levenshtein distance, and Euclidean distance to match customers with the \nmost suitable  promotional campaigns based on characteristics like departur e place, \narrival place, departure date, ticket type and price  are utilization for the research . The \nintegration of Chatfuel ch atbot and DialogFlow is pivotal to the process. Chatfuel \nfacilitates user interactions, while DialogFlow contributes to natural language \nunderstanding, aiding in the determination of customer intents during conversations. The \noverall process involves the i nitiation of conversation, data collection through forms or \npredefined questions, and the generation of targets for customized adv ertising \ncampaigns . The results showcase the effectiveness of the algorithm, with a positive user \nresponse indicating a 70% satisfaction rate regarding the accuracy of matched offers. \nHowever, the paper acknowledges certain limitations. Notably, the reliance on data \nexclusive ly from Facebook interactions raises concerns about the generalization of \nfindings across diverse social media platforms. The researchers have  primarily focuse d \non a specific industry potentially limiting its applicability to other doma ins (Hafaiedh, et \nal., 2020) . \n \n \n  6CS014  \n10 \n 5. Findings  \nThe research and analysis of papers on ad prediction showcases the effectiveness of \nadvanced techniques such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Thompson Sampling, and \nLSTM in enhancing predictive accuracy. The comparison of UCB and Thompson \nSampling demonstr ates different performances. The LSTM -RNN model, while \noutperforming baseline models, faces challenges related to computational costs. Similarly \nfor customer segmentation, the clustering algorithms such as K -Means, K -Medoids, and \nSpectral Clustering provid es valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each \nalgorithm, emphasizing the importance of choosing the appropriate method based on \ndataset characteristics and analytical goals.  Deep User Segment Interest Network \n(DUSIN) showcased promising result for click through rate prediction. The papers analyze \nthe impact of AI in post -performance, campaign effectiveness, and optimization of ad \nspending. An example shown for AdRobot uses AI for automating promotional campaigns \nbased on customer profiles a nd interactions. The study has certain limitations such as \nalgorithm sensitivity, assumptions about user behavior, and potential biases in data \ncollection.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  6CS014  \n11 \n 6. Conclusion  \nThe analysis of papers strides in the application of AI in advertising and customer \nsegmentation. With the use of reinforcement learning algorithms to the insights gained \nthrough clustering techniques implication in a system that can first track the custom er \nactivity and based on the performance of the customer activity segregate them offering \nthe businesses valuable insights for enhancing the marketing strategies based on \ncustomer behavior. I t provides valuable insights into the practical application of \nreinforcement learning for ad prediction . This innovation emerges as a solution for \nautomated and personalized marketing campaigns, leveraging AI and advanced \nalgorithms to enhance audience targeting. However, there is a need for real -world cases  \nto illustrate the practical application of clustering algorithms in diverse business scenarios, \nbridging the gap between theoretical insights and practical implications.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   6CS014  \n12 \n 7.

Deep User Segment Interest Network Modeling for Click -Through  \r\nRate Prediction of Online Advertising  \r\nThe model architecture uses Deep User Segment Interest Network (DUSIN) model to \r\ncomprise key layers, including an Embedding Layer transforming user behavior \r\nsequences, an Individual Interest Extractor Layer utilizing a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) \r\nfor extracting individual user interests, a Segment Interest Activating Layer updating \r\nsegme nt interests based on the last hidden vector, and a Segment Interest Activating \r\nLayer inspired by Deep Interest Network (DIN). Employing  the Tobacco dataset, \r\nresearchers unde rtake  preprocessing steps like under sampling for class imbalance and  \r\ndefine  user segments based on features related to age and gender.  Baseline algorithms \r\nsuch as MLP, PNN, DeepFM and DIN are compared using evaluation metrics like AUC \r\nand log loss.  Insights from segment interest are gained by visualizing differences using \r\nEuclidean distances, providing valuable perspectives on user preferences within the \r\npredefined segments. The model performance comparison demonstrates the superiority \r\nof DUSIN, with  notable AUC gains over baseline models. Specifically, DUSIN achieved \r\nan AUC gain of 0.0017 over MLP and with a sequence length of 100, a  further gain of \r\n0.0029  is noticed . The analysis of different behavior sequence lengths emphasizes the \r\nsignificance of historical user behavior, indicating optimal performance with longer \r\nsequence for DUSIN. The findings offer valuable insights into user segment dynamics, \r\nemphasizing the p ractical relevance of DUSIN in real -time advertising systems. The \r\nability of model to outperform baseline algorithms underscores its potential for enhancing \r\nCTR prediction accuracy. The consideration of different behavior sequ ence lengths \r\nprovides nuanced perspectives on the temporal aspects of user behavior. It also \r\nacknowledges certain limitations, including the reliance on predefined user segments and \r\nthe potential of dataset high dimensional spare features (Kim, et al., 2021) . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n6 \r\n 4.4. Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning  \r\nThe research performed by (Patel, et al., 2020)  focused on customer segmentation  \r\nintroduces diverse methodologies of clustering models, including the widely utilized K -\r\nmeans algorithm known for its computational efficiency, the hierarchical clustering \r\napproach that builds a hierarchy of data points, the density -based clustering repres ented \r\nby DBSCAN, and the Affinity Propagation Algorithm, which stands out for its ability to \r\nidentify clusters without a predefined number.  The methodology underscores the \r\nsignificance of CRM in modern marketing, emphasizin g its role in customer value analysis \r\nand the development of persistent  customer -company relationships. Customer \r\nsegmentation emerges as a crucial aspect, involving the division into distinct buyers  of \r\nsimilar  behaviors and characteristics. The use of clustering algorithms becomes evident \r\nas a powerful tool in predicting consumption trends and refining marketing strategies. The \r\ncomparative analysis of these clustering algorithms reveals valuable insights into t heir \r\nperformance across dimensions such as comp utation speed, adaptability to dataset \r\ncharacteristics, and overall efficiency. K -Means, for instance, exhibits high computational \r\nefficiency. K -Means, exhibits high computational efficiency bur grapples with the \r\nchallenge of dependency on the initial numb er of clusters. Hierarchical clustering, \r\nalthough versatile in cluster formation, faces limitations in computational speed, making \r\nit more suitable for smaller datasets . The finding shows the importance of choosing the \r\nappropriate clustering algorithm base d on specific dataset characteristics and analytical \r\ngoals. Moreover, it acknowledges the limitations associated with interpreting cluster \r\nmeanings and suggests a potential enhancement by addressing these challenges . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n7 \r\n 4.5. Analysis of Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for  an \r\nEfficient Customer Segmentation using Clustering Ensemble and \r\nSpectral Clustering  \r\nAn insightful analysis by the models employed for unsupervised machine learning \r\ntechniques include Mini Batch K -Means, DBSCAN, K -Means, Mean Shift, and Spectral \r\nClustering. Data is extracted , collected  from Moroccan resident s, resulting in a dataset of \r\n1357 individuals with eight distinguishing  freatures . The methodology involves applying \r\nindividual clustering models to the dataset and combining their results using clustering \r\nensemble and spectral clustering. The proposed model is then applied to a real dat aset, \r\nshowcasing its effectiveness in clustering diverse populations. Performance evaluation  \r\nusing metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), \r\nSilhouette Coefficient (SC), and Davies -Bouldin Index (DI), demonstrating the superiority \r\nof model over old method of  clustering approaches is performed . The findings showcase  \r\nthe distinct clusters based on demographics and socioeconomic attributes. Cluster 3 \r\ncomprises educated, high income, non -single females in large cities, whil e Cluster 4 \r\nconsists of single men with higher incomes in urban centers. Median age comparisons \r\nhighlight variations across clusters, with Cluster 2 and 3 showing younger ages (28.5 and \r\n29), and Clusters 1 and 4 exhibiting notably older ages (36 and 37). A pplication to a real \r\ndataset identifies five clusters, with Cluster 0 representing middle class single men and \r\nCluster 4 comprising married women with high income and education. The proposed \r\nmodel outperforms traditional models in performance metrics, with  ARI, NMI, SC, and DI \r\nvalues of 0.7014, 0.7175, 0.7289, and 0.7515, respectively, indicating its efficacy in \r\ncapturing complex patterns within datasets.  However, the study has limitations. It primarily \r\nrelies on traditional clustering models, g eneralizing may be limited to the specific \r\ncharacteristics of the Moroccan residents surveyed  (Karim & Hicham, 2022) .  \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n8 \r\n 4.6. K-Means and K -Medoids Clustering Methods for Customer  \r\nSegmentation in Online Retail Datasets  \r\nIn this research  conducted by (Mufarroha, et al., 2022) , gives  light on the application of \r\nK-Means and K -Medoids clustering methods for customer segmentation in  the online \r\nretail datasets. The research employed a methodology encompassing various stages. \r\nData collection involved the utilization of online retail customer data obtained from Kaggle, \r\ncomprising parameters such as invoice, stock code, description, invoice data, price, \r\ncustomer ID, and country. The subsequent data preprocessing steps included handling \r\nmissing values, conducting regency, frequency, and  monetary (RFM) analysis, \r\naddressing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR), and normalizing the data. The \r\nclustering methods applied were K -Means and K -Medoids, each requiring the \r\ndetermination of the optimal number of cluster (K). The elbow method was employed for \r\nthis purpose. For K -Means, the study identified the optimal K value as 4, resulting in four \r\ndistinct clusters with specific characteristics related to customer behavior. K -Medoids, \r\nwith an optimal K value of 6, formed six clusters, offerin g a more detailed segmentation \r\nbased on RFM analysis . The results analysis involved an examination and interpretation \r\nof the characteristics of each cluster obtained from both clustering methods. Making the \r\nimportance of preprocessing steps and  highlighting the implications for businesses in \r\ntailoring their strategies based on the identified customer clusters , findings  are explained \r\nproperly . The generalization of the findings maybe be constrained due to the specific \r\ncharacteristics of the dataset and  focus  on clustering techniques neglects the exploration \r\nof other potential factors influencing customer behavior. The reliance on the elbow \r\nmethod for finding  the most favorable  number of clusters may not be universally \r\napplicable, and analysis with alternative clustering algorithms is absent . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n9 \r\n 4.7. AdRobot: A Smart Segmentation Application for Automated & \r\nPersonalized Marketing Campaigns  \r\nThis paper addresses a critical challenge in contemporary marketing connecting the right \r\npromotional campaign with the right audience in the digital area. The authors present \r\nAdRobot as a solution, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to automat e and \r\npersonalize the marketing strategies. The proposed algorithm investigates profiling and \r\nconversational data, employing AI heuristics to adeptly match audiences with tailored \r\npromotional campaigns. The methodology comprises two key data collection app roaches. \r\nFirstly, conversational constraints are automatically gathered from interactions with the \r\nChatfuel chatbot, encompassing  details such as age, field of work, marital  status, and \r\ninterests. Secondly, customer responses to marketing agent posts on social media \r\nplatforms, including likes, dislikes, ratings, and comments, are collected.  Distance \r\ncorrelation, Levenshtein distance, and Euclidean distance to match customers with the \r\nmost suitable  promotional campaigns based on characteristics like departur e place, \r\narrival place, departure date, ticket type and price  are utilization for the research . The \r\nintegration of Chatfuel ch atbot and DialogFlow is pivotal to the process. Chatfuel \r\nfacilitates user interactions, while DialogFlow contributes to natural language \r\nunderstanding, aiding in the determination of customer intents during conversations. The \r\noverall process involves the i nitiation of conversation, data collection through forms or \r\npredefined questions, and the generation of targets for customized adv ertising \r\ncampaigns . The results showcase the effectiveness of the algorithm, with a positive user \r\nresponse indicating a 70% satisfaction rate regarding the accuracy of matched offers. \r\nHowever, the paper acknowledges certain limitations. Notably, the reliance on data \r\nexclusive ly from Facebook interactions raises concerns about the generalization of \r\nfindings across diverse social media platforms. The researchers have  primarily focuse d \r\non a specific industry potentially limiting its applicability to other doma ins (Hafaiedh, et \r\nal., 2020) . \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n10 \r\n 5. Findings  \r\nThe research and analysis of papers on ad prediction showcases the effectiveness of \r\nadvanced techniques such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Thompson Sampling, and \r\nLSTM in enhancing predictive accuracy. The comparison of UCB and Thompson \r\nSampling demonstr ates different performances. The LSTM -RNN model, while \r\noutperforming baseline models, faces challenges related to computational costs. Similarly \r\nfor customer segmentation, the clustering algorithms such as K -Means, K -Medoids, and \r\nSpectral Clustering provid es valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each \r\nalgorithm, emphasizing the importance of choosing the appropriate method based on \r\ndataset characteristics and analytical goals.  Deep User Segment Interest Network \r\n(DUSIN) showcased promising result for click through rate prediction. The papers analyze \r\nthe impact of AI in post -performance, campaign effectiveness, and optimization of ad \r\nspending. An example shown for AdRobot uses AI for automating promotional campaigns \r\nbased on customer profiles a nd interactions. The study has certain limitations such as \r\nalgorithm sensitivity, assumptions about user behavior, and potential biases in data \r\ncollection.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  6CS014  \r\n11 \r\n 6. Conclusion  \r\nThe analysis of papers strides in the application of AI in advertising and customer \r\nsegmentation. With the use of reinforcement learning algorithms to the insights gained \r\nthrough clustering techniques implication in a system that can first track the custom er \r\nactivity and based on the performance of the customer activity segregate them offering \r\nthe businesses valuable insights for enhancing the marketing strategies based on \r\ncustomer behavior. I t provides valuable insights into the practical application of \r\nreinforcement learning for ad prediction . This innovation emerges as a solution for \r\nautomated and personalized marketing campaigns, leveraging AI and advanced \r\nalgorithms to enhance audience targeting. However, there is a need for real -world cases  \r\nto illustrate the practical application of clustering algorithms in diverse business scenarios, \r\nbridging the gap between theoretical insights and practical implications.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n   6CS014  \r\n12 \r\n 7.

Problem Statement  \r\nDue to the expansion in digital information, a challenge of information overloading has \r\nbeen seen . Dealing with lengthy documents and research materials becomes time \r\nconsuming, hindering the ability to extract crucial information quickly.  A study \r\npublished in Nature Communication reveals that our collective attention span is \r\nnarrowing. This is not just on social media but also in different domains , that people \r\nare losing their attention span  (Lorenz -Spreen, et al., 2019) . Due to the low attention \r\nspan, most individuals are not likely to read journals, books, and other documented \r\nfiles. The rise of audio -visual content has also impacted the consumption of text -based \r\ninformation. These days the way of consuming information ha s changed which is a 6CS007  \r\n5 \r\n positive thing but in context of a person with academic background in performing \r\nresearch based on text -based documents,  one of the pain -points I have been facing  \r\nis analyzing and curating the contents from lengthy documents . In the professional  \r\nworld, handling and extracting major key points  from proposals  and documents could \r\nbe a terrible task for working individuals until there is a summarization tool that makes \r\nthe task easier.  \r\n1.5.4.  Project as Solution  \r\nProfessionals, researchers, and students face challenges of extracting content from \r\nresearch papers and journals. This summarization tool will extract important insights \r\nfrom a paper to make informed decisions quickly.  Dealing with lengthy documents that \r\nrequire significant time and effort is a terrible task, the project will be able to minimize \r\nthe time required and will prioritize important documents. This  tool will help streamline \r\nthe process of summarizing and aggregating information from multiple sourc es and \r\nwill store it for further usage of the user.  People will be able to access necessary \r\ncontent  in a short format,  saving time.  It will encourage continuous learning by allowing \r\nusers to explore a broader range of topics within a shorter time frame.  \r\n2. Initial Research  \r\n2.1. Hugging Face  \r\nHugging Face is a platform for data science and machine learning which was initially \r\ndeveloped in 2017 as a chatbot app for teenagers but has expanded its domain from \r\njust a chatbot app. This platform has a range of functionalities from creating, hosting, \r\nand managing their own AI models to engaging in discussions and collaborations \r\nwithin the platform. Hugging face also holds a substantial collection of models and \r\ndatasets created by the collaborators and users. This platform encompasses a range \r\nof AI appl ications like computer vision, audio analysis, and natural language \r\nprocessing (Rebelo, 2023) . \r\n2.2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  \r\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a division of AI that aims to make computers \r\ncomprehend, analyze, and produce human language. NLP plays and significant role \r\nin extracting the most meaningful information. NLP encompasses various techniques \r\nand methods to process and understand human language. The division of NLP 6CS007  \r\n6 \r\n approaches extractive and abstractive summarization, along with other categories \r\nsuch as single -document, multi -document, and query -based summarization.  \r\n2.2.1.  Abstractive Summarization  \r\nAbstractive summarization is a method where the generated summary doesn’t \r\nnecessarily consist of sentences present in the original text, instead it creates new \r\nsentences that capture the key concepts. This is a approach where the new texts are \r\ngenerated on ly after abstracting and understanding the semantic meaning of the text \r\nwhile capturing the key concepts of the original content.  \r\n2.2.2.  Extractive Summarization  \r\nSimilarly, Extractive summarization involves choosing sentences directly from the \r\nsource text to create a concise summarization. Then the chosen text based content is \r\ntypically chosen based on its importance and relevance. This method aims to retain \r\nthe or iginal wording from the text, making it more conservative approach to \r\nsummarization (Adhikari, et al., 2020) .  \r\n3. Literature Review  \r\n3.1. NLP Based Text Summarization Using Semantic Analysis  \r\n3.1.1.  Introduction  \r\nText Summarization is a supervised learning method, that heavily relies on Natural \r\nLanguage Processing (NLP), which helps in generating concise and comprehensive \r\nsummaries from massive number of text -based inputs.  \r\nThis literature review focuses on the research paper titled “NLP Based Text \r\nSummarization Using Sematic Analysis” which introduces an innovative approach for \r\nspecific text summarization. To save manual effort in information processing, the study \r\ndiscusses the challenges of summarizing large texts and highlights the use of \r\nautomatic summarization tools. The author offers a method based on Semantic \r\nAnalysis, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps in extracting \r\nrepresentative sentences and generates meaningful summaries.  \r\n 6CS007  \r\n7 \r\n 3.1.2.  Methodology  \r\nThe proposed methodology in this research paper leverages a technique based on \r\nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for text summarization. LSA is used to extract \r\nsemantically important sentences and generate a summary of the input text. First, the \r\ninput documen t undergoes data preprocessing method, where irrelevant words such \r\nas stop, words are removed to enhance the quality of the summary. A matrix of word \r\ncounts is constructed from preprocessed text, representing the occurrence of words \r\nacross sentences. The s entence matrix undergoes Singular Value Decomposition \r\n(SVD) to reduce dimensionality and identify the latent semantic structure of the text. \r\nThis helps in identifying the most noticeable feature of the document, enabling \r\nextraction of meaningful sentences for summary. Based on latent semantic structure, \r\nthe system identifies the most relevant sentence and arranges them in a coherent \r\nmanner to generate the final summary.  \r\n \r\nFigure 2  Proposed System (Moiyadi, et al., 2016)  \r\nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used for \r\nidentifying the most important sentences in a text document. Below is the \r\nmathematical equation for the LSA method.  \r\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD)  \r\nSVD is used to factorize the term -document matrix into three matrices: u, ∑, and v  \r\nu, s, v = svds (matrix, k= num_concepts)  \r\n6CS007  \r\n8 \r\n Saliency Vector Calculation  \r\nThe saliency of each sentence is calculated as the dot product of the squared values \r\nin u and v.  \r\nsaliency_vec = np.dot (np.square(u), np.square(v))  \r\nTopic Filtering  \r\nSingular values below a certain threshold controlled by topic_sigma_threshold are set \r\nto zero to filter out less significant topics.  \r\nu [u < sigma_threshold] = 0  \r\nTop Sentence Selection  \r\nThe top sentences are selected based on their saliency scores.  \r\ntop_sentences = saliency_vec.argsort() [ -length:] [:: -1] \r\nHere, the code implements Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to perform text \r\nsummarization. First the input text is preprocessed, and a term -document matrix is \r\ngenerated. Then SVD is applied to identify the important topics and sentences and at \r\nlast the salien t sentences are selected to create a summary.  \r\n3.1.3.  Discussion  \r\nThe authors applied LSA -based summarization technique to a diverse set of texts and \r\nevaluated the performance of generated summaries. They measured the quality of the \r\nsummaries using various metrics, including ROUGE scores, F1 -score, and precision -\r\nrecall c urves. The study indicates that LSA approach performed better than existing \r\nsummarization techniques (Moiyadi, et al., 2016) .  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 6CS007  \r\n9 \r\n 3.2. Survey on NLP based automatic extractive text  \r\nsummarization using Spacy  \r\n3.2.1.  Introduction  \r\nThis article provides a general overview of the area of NLP -based automated text \r\nsummarization. It seeks to discuss and evaluate frequently used summarizing \r\ntechniques by the researchers with an emphasis on useful and successful tactics with \r\nan insight int o the evolution of summarization. The major key points that the article \r\ndiscusses are the difficulties of numerically evaluating the quality of summary and the \r\ndistinctions between extractive and abstractive summarization.  \r\nThe article offers a comprehensive examination of text summarization, tracing its \r\nevolution from early IBM research in 1950s to modern methods. The authors delve \r\ninto the fundamental ideas behind extractive summarizing techniques, putting special \r\nemphasis on the importance of elements like key phrase recognition and sentence \r\npositioning during the summarization procedure. These methods are considered as \r\nthe pillars that support the development of contemporary extractive summarization \r\napproaches.  \r\n3.2.2.  NLP and Ambiguity  \r\nText summarization and other applications, such as language translation and \r\nchatbots, rely heavily on NLP, which emphasizes its importance in comprehending \r\nand interpreting human language. NLP is complicated because natural language is \r\noften unclear and un certain. There are different types of uncertainties in language: \r\nLexical ambiguity; that occurs when a single word has multiple meanings. Syntactic \r\nambiguity: this occurs from the way words are structured in sentences. For instance, \r\nthe phrase “Visiting re latives can be tedious” can have two different interpretations. \r\nLastly, semantic ambiguity: this occurs when the meaning of words themselves are \r\nunclear.  \r\n \r\n3.2.3.  Phases of Natural Language Processing  \r\nThe article claims that the phases of NLP including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, \r\nsemantic analysis, discourse integration and pragmatic analysis help in analyzing \r\nambiguities. Lexical analysis is the first step where the sentences are divided into  6CS007  \r\n10 \r\n tokens. For the second step, syntactic analysis or parsing is performed, where the \r\nword order is studied then in semantic analysis meaning and word order is analyzed. \r\nAfter performing discourse integration, pragmatic analysis is performed which is the \r\nlast stage, where real impact of text is gained.  \r\n \r\n \r\nFigure 3 Phases of Natural Language Processing (Prakash, et al., 2022) . \r\n3.2.4.  Preprocessing  \r\nTo retrieve valid information, pre -processing steps in text summarization are depicted \r\nin the article including sentence separation, stop words removal, stemming, part -of \r\nspeech tagging and keyword extraction.  \r\n3.2.5.  Conclusion  \r\nThe authors make recommendations for potential future text summarizing research. \r\nThey draw attention to the fact that it can be difficult to reach consensus between \r\nmultiple annotators and that we need more effective tools to automatically verify text \r\nsumm aries. This demonstrates how the industry is developing and working towards \r\nmore effective automatic text summarization systems (Prakash, et al., 2022) . \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n6CS007  \r\n11 \r\n 3.3. Implementation of NLP based on automatic text \r\nsummarization using spacy  \r\nSummarization of large texts has become a pivotal task in natural language processing \r\n(NLP) and has garnered significant attention in both academic research and \r\ncommercial applications. In recent years, the field of text summarization has witnessed \r\nsignifi cant advancements, driven by the integration of deep learning models and NLP \r\ntechniques. This article explores the state of the art in automatic text summarization, \r\nwith a focus on summarization techniques, challenges, and the role of libraires like \r\nSpaCy.  With the two different methods of summarization i.e., extractive, and \r\nabstractive summarization. A method utilizing K -Means clustering for sentence \r\nselection in extractive method was introduced which involves in preprocessing the \r\ninput text by removing th e stop words, hyphens, and extra spaces followed by n -grams \r\nto select the features and applying clustering techniques.  \r\n3.3.1.  Summarization Techniques  \r\nAn unsupervised framework called SummCoder for extractive summarization was \r\nintroduced that employs a scoring system, considering sentence content relevance, \r\nsentence novelty, and sentence position relevance, to select sentences for the \r\nsummary. A graph -based extraction system was introduced in the paper that utilizes \r\nthe nouns as nodes and non -nouns words as edge. This approach considers the \r\nrelationship between nouns and selects the sentences based on prominence of nouns, \r\nachieving effective sentence extr action.  \r\nThe paper also suggests that abstractive summarization methods are more \r\nchallenging but hold the promise of creating more human -like summaries. Zheng and \r\nLapata proposed PacSumm, which employs a graph -based rank algorithm and utilizes \r\nBERT (Bidirectional E ncoder Representation from Transformers) for representation \r\nmapping which leverages transformer -based model to create abstractive summaries \r\nby considering the relationships between sentences.  \r\n3.3.2.  Spacy in Text Summarization  \r\nThe automatic text summarization with the above techniques faced challenges \r\nparticularly with abstractive summarization. However, the recent advancements in \r\ndeep learning have improved. SpaCy is an open -source NLP library in Python, that \r\nplays a significan t role in text summarization and sentence extraction. It offers a range 6CS007  \r\n12 \r\n of NLP functionalities, including tokenization, part -of-speech tagging, parsing, and \r\nnamed entity recognition. These features are essential for the preprocessing and \r\nunderstanding the structure of the input text. It supports deep learning workflows with \r\nmodels compatible with PyTorch and TensoFlow. It provides accurate parsing, \r\nsentence boundary detection and access to the word vectors making it a valuable tool \r\nfor researchers and developers working on text summarization projects.  \r\n3.3.3.  Discussion  \r\nThe text summarization process in this article follows several key steps. The initial \r\nphase involves preparing the input text for the summarization. This addresses the \r\nissues commonly found in unstructured text, such as line breaks, special characters, \r\nunwanted spaces, and punctuation. Then, the stop words are removed which are the \r\nwords which contribute little meaning are eliminated. After the removal of stop words, \r\ntokenization is performed which splits the sentences into individual words, forming \r\ntokens.  Then the selection and extraction of significant sentences from the \r\npreprocessed text is performed. This step involves frequency analysis, weight \r\ncalculation of each word determined by dividing frequency by maximum frequency. \r\nKey phrases in the input text  are reviewed and sentences are scored by summing \r\nweighted frequencies of word then the token list is sorted in descending order based \r\non scores. The sentences with the highest score are selected for inclusion in the final \r\nsummary. This method is further i ntegrated with NLP frameworks using libraries like \r\nSpaCy which enables efficient extraction of informative summaries (Nayana, et al., \r\n2022) . \r\n \r\nFigure 4 Architecture for text summarization using SpaCy (Nayana, et al., 2022)  \r\n6CS007  \r\n13 \r\n 3.4. Automatic Text Summarization Using Gensim Word2Vec \r\nand K -Means Clustering Algorithm  \r\n3.4.1.  Introduction  \r\nThis paper gives us two necessary approaches for text summarization which are \r\nextractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive involves choosing relevant \r\nsentences, paragraphs, or phrases directly from the source and then summarizing it. \r\nOn the other h and, abstractive creates new sentences by rephrasing the original text \r\nusing words that are not in the source document. The primary objective of this research \r\nis to summarize single documents using a sentence -based model with clustering. The \r\nstudy leverage s Gensim Word2Vec for feature extraction, aiming to identify the main \r\nconcept across the sentences.  \r\nThe model proposed by this paper is primarily a sentence -based clustering approach \r\nfor summarizing news articles. The BBC news article dataset consisting of 2,225 news \r\narticles were categorized into five groups (business, entertainment, politics, sport, an d \r\ntech) which were used for the research. To prepare the data for analysis, sentences \r\nwere first tokenized where text was divided into sentences using NLTK library. \r\nUnnecessary characters were removed, commonly occurring stop words were \r\neliminated, duplica te words within each sentence were removed retaining only one \r\ninstance and then words in the text were lemmatized to obtain their root forms.  \r\n3.4.2.  Word2Vec  \r\nWord2Vec, a widely used word embedding technique in neural networks, was \r\nemployed. Word2Vec method involves two terms: Skip Gram and Common Bag of \r\nWords (CBOW). For the implementation method, Skip Gram was chosen due to its \r\neffectiveness with small data am ounts and uncommon words. CBOW takes meaning \r\nof each word from the file and tires to predict the target word using single context input. \r\nThis technique generated vector representations for each word, with similar words \r\nhaving closer spatial positions (Karani, 2018) .  \r\nsin(𝑋,𝑌)= cos(𝜃)=(𝑋.𝑌)\r\n||𝑋|| ||𝑌|| \r\n 6CS007  \r\n14 \r\n 3.4.3.  Gensim Word2Vec  \r\nAnother open -source library for unsupervised learning is Gensim, which uses \r\nWord2Vec to create word vectors from tokenized word lists based on Latent Dirichlet \r\nAllocation (LDA).  \r\n3.4.4.  K-Means Clustering  \r\nData points with comparable characteristics were grouped into groups using K -Means \r\nclustering. K -Means seeks to reduce the squared distance between each data point \r\nand the cluster center. Below is an algorithmic representation of K -Means.  \r\nLet M = {m1, m2, m3,….,mn} be collection of data points and V = {v1, v2, v3,..., vc} \r\nare the centers.  \r\n1. A cluster of the center named c was chosen at random.  \r\n2. The distinction between a cluster center and a single data point is established.  \r\n3. Cluster center datapoints are assigned to cluster centers within the shortest travel \r\ntime.  \r\n4. The following factors are used to identify the new center of cluster:  \r\n𝑣𝑖=(1)\r\n(𝑐𝑖)∑𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑖\r\n𝑗=1 \r\n1. New cluster centers are found by recalculating the distance between each data \r\npoint.  \r\n2. If there is no reallocated data point, step 3 is repeated. (Ortega, et al., 2009) . \r\n3.4.5.  Elbow Method to find k  \r\nThe ideal value of k, which stands for the number of clusters used in the model, was \r\nfound using the elbow approach. The final step involved generating the summary. The \r\ncluster with the highest number of sentences, indicating the most valuable sentences, \r\nwas selected.  \r\nThe steps to follow elbow method.  \r\n1. The range of K is 1 to 9.  \r\n2. Here, the value of k is  Increased  by 1.  6CS007  \r\n15 \r\n Third, calculate the distortion.  \r\n4. The point at which the distortion starts to linearly decrease.   \r\n \r\nFigure 5 The elbow with k =2 in business_doc_465 (Haider, et al., 2020)  \r\n3.4.6.  Evaluation  \r\nThe Word2Vec model was used to calculate the mean similarity of the sentences \r\ninside the cluster while taking noun and number content into account. The sentences \r\nwere chosen to produce a summary of the original text that was one -third as long. Two \r\ntexts ha ve been compared using the BELU score. The score for each category of the \r\nnews article in the image below, from lowest to highest, is calculated using BELU. The \r\nmodel for the business article outperformed the others. For business items, the highest \r\nBELU sc ore was 0.894 (Haider, et al., 2020) .  \r\n \r\nFigure 6 BELU Score for business article (Haider, et al., 2020)  \r\n6CS007  \r\n16 \r\n  \r\nFigure 7 Summary score comparison between news article categories (Haider, et al., 2020)  \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n6CS007  \r\n17 \r\n 3.5. Speed Reading Tool Powered by Artificial Intelligence for \r\nStudents with ADHD, Dyslexia, or Short Attention Span  \r\nThe paper reveals that the development of AI -based solutions to improve reading \r\ncomprehension and speed among the people with ADHD (Attention Deficit \r\nHyperactivity Disorder) or dyslexia has represented great advancement in the sector \r\nof education and acces sibility. Although there have been traditional speed -reading \r\nmethods, they frequently need substantial training and practice. However, many \r\nresearches and developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural \r\nLanguage Processing (NLP) have paved a way for the development of AI powered \r\nspeed -reading tools that can automatically summarize the texts facilitating efficient \r\ninformation intake.  \r\n3.5.1.  T5 Model  \r\nThe proposed model discussed in this paper uses a pre -trained model to generate \r\nsummaries of the input text. The tool includes features such as custom bolding feature, \r\nhighlighting the important information and feature to adjust the line, word and characte r \r\nspacing in the tool for custom reading preference. The pretrained model used by this \r\ntool is T5 (Text -to-Text Transfer Transformer) provided by Transformers library, a \r\nmodel from Hugging Face. The model was further fine -tuned to allow generate \r\naccurate a nd personalized summaries (Raffel, et al., 2020) .  \r\n3.5.2.  Transformer Architecture  \r\nThe transformer architecture was introduced by Vaswani and their colleague in their \r\ngroundbreaking paper named “Attention is All You Need” in 2017 that has \r\nrevolutionized use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its tasks (Vaswani, et \r\nal., 2017) . The core concept of this architecture lies in self -attention, often referred to \r\nas scaled dot -product attention, enabling the model to weigh the importance of the \r\ndifferent words in a sequence when processing specific words.  \r\n3.5.3.  Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs)  \r\nThe transformer architecture is incorporated with Feedforward Neural Networks that \r\nplays a pivotal role in the processing and generating expressive representations. The \r\nencoder and decoder layers of the Transformer compute the attention score for each \r\ntoken in the data entered which is the input sequence. The outputs from the self -\r\nattention layer are channeled through FFNNs which consists of two linear 6CS007  \r\n18 \r\n transformations, which is often followed by a non -linear activation function such as \r\nRectified Linear Unit (ReLU), introducing non -linearity and enabling complex pattern \r\nand relationship learning within the data.  \r\n3.5.4.  Tool Implementation  \r\nIn implementing AI -based speed -reading tool, T5 tokenizer is set to “t5 -base” which \r\nhandles the sequences with a maximum of 512 tokens and T5 model is loaded with \r\n“t5-base” for summarization. To manage long paragraphs, the text is divided into \r\nsmaller 512 -token chunks, ensuring the summarization process retains important \r\ninformation. The system uses Flask as the development framework, which is a \r\nlightweight web server framework to handle user input, process the text and apply the \r\nalgorithms from the python script. For the interface the proposed tool uses HTML, \r\nCSS, and JavaScript to display the summarized information. The below figure is a \r\nscreenshot of the user interface of the summarizing too l (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023).   \r\n \r\nFigure 8 Summarizing user interface (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023)  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n6CS007  \r\n19 \r\n 3.6. Hybrid Long Document Summarization using C2F -FAR and \r\nChatGPT: A Practical Study  \r\nLong Document summarization has drawn a lot of attention nowadays in the field of \r\ninformation retrieval. The development of cutting -edge language models like C2F -FAR \r\nand ChatGPT has created new opportunities for exploring the real -world uses of hybrid \r\nsumm arization pipelines. This paper gives significant research initiatives and \r\nadvancements in lengthy document summarization and focuses on the advantages \r\nand difficulties of the hybrid approaches used in this paper.  \r\nDue to the extensive amount of information and the need for consistency and integrity \r\nin the summaries, long documents have issues while summarizing because of large \r\namount of information and the need of coherence summaries. Traditional extractive \r\nmethods tend to struggle with generating coherent and concise summaries. Large \r\nlanguage models like ChatGPT enable abstractive approaches addressing the \r\nchallenges but also have problems with content hallucination and stylistic \r\ninconsistencies.  \r\n3.6.1.  C2F-FAR \r\nIn this paper, C2F -FAR (Content -to-flow Extractive Facilitated Abstractive \r\nsummarization) was introduced that offers an extractive summarization approach for \r\nlong documents. It relies on sentence extraction to identify key information, aiming to \r\nenhance th e summaries. The study shows that C2F -FAR can generate summaries \r\nwith competitive automated metrics, indicating its potential as a basis for hybrid \r\nsummarization. It can automatically select sentences from a document by considering \r\nthe semantics similarity  between blocks of text and between different sentences. The \r\nbelow figure illustrates the application of default C2F -FAR settings to 20 cleaned \r\narticles, demonstrating that the number of blocks partitions generally increases with \r\nthe number of sentences in  an article which shows that the model can automatically \r\ncapture semantic blocks in text.  6CS007  \r\n20 \r\n  \r\nFigure 9 Testing C2F -FAR default settings on 20 articles (Lu, et al., 2023).  \r\n \r\n3.6.2.  ChatGPT  \r\nThe research also focused on utilizing ChatGPT for summarization, specifically in the \r\ncontext of extractive summaries generated by C2F -FAR with a particular emphasis on \r\nlong documents. The summarization process involved in the two -step prompting \r\nmethod gen erally yielded satisfactory summary length compared to human written \r\nsummaries. However, repeated requests for additional details led to irrelevancy. \r\nThese summarizations were performed based on GPT -3.5, except for the final test \r\nusing GPT -4 for summarizin g the entire book.  \r\n3.6.3.  Evaluation  \r\nFor the evaluation, automated metrics such as ROGUE and BERT Score were used \r\nwhich suggested that machine -generated summaries are equivalent with the human \r\nwritten ones. The evaluation of summarization pipeline involved both human and \r\nautomated metrics. Hu man evaluations reveal critical issues related to coherence, \r\nfaithfulness, and style. The below figure shows the paraphrasing ability of ChatGPT \r\nagainst C2F -FAR extracted sentences using 20 cleaned articles.  \r\n \r\nFigure 10 Evaluation of article summarizes with various metrics (Lu, et al., 2023).  \r\n6CS007  \r\n21 \r\n In the figure above, when ChatGPT paraphrases sentences extracted by C2F -FAR, it \r\nleads to slightly lower ROGUE -1 and BALANC scores, but a slightly higher BERT \r\nScore compared to C2F -FAR generated summaries. ROGUE -2 and ROGUE -L scores \r\nremain largely unchange d. However, paraphrasing introduces new words to convey \r\nthe same meaning resulting in higher ESTIME alarms and lower ESTIME soft values \r\ncompared to C2F -FAR generated summaries. Despite this, ChatGPT’s ESTIME \r\nalarms value remains lower than human written su mmaries and ESTIME soft value \r\nremains higher. In conclusion, ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to rewrite text to \r\nsome extent while maintaining overall summary quality (Lu, et al., 2023).  \r\n4. Project Methodology  \r\n4.1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  \r\n \r\nFigure 11 Work breakdown structure  \r\n \r\n4.2. Software Development Methodology  \r\nTo organize the software development cycle, Kanban Methodology will be used. \r\nKanban is a method used to manage and optimize workflows in project management \r\nby emphasizing visual work, limiting work in progress, and promoting continuous \r\nimprovement. Choosin g Kanban for individual software development offers distinct \r\nadvantages over other SDLC methodologies. Kanban allows high flexibility as it deals \r\nwith prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency since solo developers \r\noften face quick change in  priority. It encourages a constant flow of deliverables \r\n6CS007  \r\n22 \r\n leading to quicker feedback. It allows individual developers to manage their work in a \r\nway that suits their own pace and style, as it does not have a predefined iteration like \r\nScrum, allowing them not to spend time on detailed planning sessions or assignin g \r\ntasks (Raut, 2015).  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nFigure 12 Glimpse to Trello  \r\nTrello will be utilized to follow the Kanban method, utilizing its visual card -based \r\nsystem for effective task and project management. Trello was launched in 2011, \r\nattributed to user friendly design and adaptability which helped it in gaining popularity. \r\nIn Trello, the tasks are visualized as cards or sticky notes on a visual board which is \r\nkanban and, usually divided into columns that represent different stages of the \r\nworkflow, such as ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’ and ‘Done’. These cards are movable across \r\nthe c olumns to reflect the progress of the work (Johnson, 2021) .  \r\n4.3. Evidence of Project Management  \r\n4.3.1.  Project Milestones Achieved  \r\nThe project Document to Text Summarization using AI has made substantial progress \r\nin delivering a functional system. Since the whole project was divided into several \r\nsystems, which includes User Management System, Document Management System, \r\nSummarization System, and Database System. It was easier to work on each \r\nfunctional system. The project initiated with the implementation of Kanban \r\nmethodology using Trello proved to be a highly effective approach for managing this \r\n6CS007  \r\n23 \r\n project. Trello provided me with the visual organization of the project, and with the help \r\nof automation, I was able to organize tasks, track progress and adapt to changing \r\npriorities seamlessly.  \r\n4.3.2.  Sprint Planning  \r\n4.3.2.1.  Initial Phase  \r\nThe project was initiated with the research and design phase. In the research phase, \r\nindividual research, literature reviews, survey forms and reviewing other systems \r\nhelped me picturize the system. With the initial requirement and research, I was able \r\nto design a basic wireframe and then give a brand theme and identity to my Lo -Fi \r\ndesign where I improved my wireframes and prepared Hi -Fi UI designs with a theme \r\nthat followed the color, typography, and basic layout of the system. While surveying \r\nthe system, I was able to gather the challenges and scenarios where this system can \r\nbe useful.  \r\n \r\nFigure 13 Sample survey 1  \r\n \r\nFigure 14 Sample survey 2  \r\n6CS007  \r\n24 \r\n 4.3.2.2.  Development Phase  \r\nThe development phase was initiated with the use of GitHub from August 20, 2023, \r\nhere I was able to work with the Django framework for the system development where \r\nwith the assigned tasks in Trello for Sprint 1, related to User Management followed by \r\nthe d evelopment on login, signup and logout were performed. Along with user \r\nmanagement, Document Management System and Database Management System \r\nwere successfully established. Here, authentication features for users, profile \r\nfunctionalities, uploading and stor ing documents were developed. The work on API \r\nbased summarization was done from implementing the summarization in Notebook to \r\nintegrating it to the system. At the end of Sprint 1, initiation of research and \r\ndevelopment on Summarization System was done. The  progress on the development \r\nis demonstrated below with the help of GitHub insights.  \r\n \r\nFigure 15 Work insight in GitHub  for contributions  \r\nFor Sprint 2, major updates in the development done in Sprint 1 were performed where \r\nfirstly, forgotten password authentication, popup modal, upgrading the frontend, use \r\nof messages and other tasks were performed. The issues in implementing API were \r\nconcerned.  \r\nTo track every task is going seamlessly as planned in the Gantt Chart, proper \r\noptimization and use of GitHub, Trello Board and Meeting Minutes were done.  \r\n6CS007  \r\n25 \r\n  \r\nFigure 16 Commits track in GitHub  \r\n \r\n5. Different Technologies and Tools Used  \r\n5.1. HTML/ CSS/ JS  \r\nHTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for front -end development for this system, where \r\nHTML helps in structuring the content where CSS helps in defining the visual \r\nrepresentation of the HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and attractive design. \r\nSimilarly, JavaScript helps in adding interactivity, enabling dynamic content updates \r\nand enhancing the user engagement.  \r\n5.2. Django Framework  \r\nDjango Framework was chosen for backend due to my familiarity with Python \r\nlanguage. Django is known for its effectiveness in handling web applications. It is a \r\nfree and open -source web framework for Python that accelerates the development of \r\nweb applicatio ns. It offers a more effective method to build and develop web programs \r\nthat initiating from scratch because it removes the need to build the backend, APIs, \r\nJavaScript (IBM, 2023) .  \r\n5.3. MariaDB  \r\nTo store the data, MariaDB will be used due to its user -friendly interface simplifies \r\ndatabase management, making it an excellent choice for an uncomplicated database \r\nsolution.  \r\n6CS007  \r\n26 \r\n 5.4. NLP Model  \r\nNLP model is the proposed model that will be used for the machine learning aspect of \r\nthe system. TextRank is one of the algorithms that extracts important sentences from \r\na document. Similarly for the proposed system, transformer -based models such as \r\nBERT a nd BART could be used for abstractive summarization (Pietro, 2022) . \r\n \r\n6. Artefact Designs  \r\n6.1.

Gantt Chart  \r\n1.2.1.  Proposed Gantt Chart  \r\nBelow is a proposed Gantt Chart of the overall timeline of the project. Here the project \r\ntimeline is divided into six phases. The first phase is the phase of project initiation \r\nwhere the requirement gathering, research and proposal is prepared for the project. \r\nBased on the first phase the second phase starts with the basic vis ualization of the \r\noverall system through wireframing and creating the User Interface (UI) and User \r\nExperience (UX) of the system. After this, the phase of development kicks off with the \r\nintegration of API in a crude system without a frontend. The evaluatio n of the API \r\nsystem will be conducted and then the NLP model will be developed which includes \r\nthe preprocessing, model architecture design, model training, and fine tuning of the \r\nsystem. The model will then be displayed after the front -end development and the \r\nbackend development will help in setting up the backend with database integration. \r\nFinally, a final documentation of the whole project will be done accordingly as shown \r\nin the Gantt Chart below.  \r\n \r\nFigure 34 Proposed Gantt Chart  \r\n6CS007  \r\n57 \r\n 1.2.2.

	(59, 2, 'Guidelines for Week 5 Assignment_2-1.docx', 13808, 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'Taxation is the system through which governments impose fees on people, companies, and other institutions in order to pay for public expenditures and operations. These fees, periodically known as taxes, constitute necessary payments enforced by law and collected from officials of the government. Taxes are utilized for funding a range of government operations, including construction of infrastructure, education, medical care, safety, welfare agencies, and other services provided by the government. The system of taxation usually charges tax on income, profits, belongings, goods and services, investment gains, and operations, besides various other forms of income. Taxation is an essential element of economic policy, has an important effect on numerous facets of society as a whole including the business factors, choices made by individuals, and plans for retirement. This essay depicts a comparative examination of three key taxation types- personal tax on income, corporate taxes, and sales taxation-across a number of nations in order to determine excellent business settings, beneficial income-earning places, as well as suitable retirement locations on the basis of taxation considerations.\r\nOECD countries\r\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is a global organization formed up of 38 member nations. The OECD was created in 1961 to promote strategies with the goal of enhancing the financial and social well-being of people throughout the world. The OECD`s nation members mainly consist of developed countries with economies that are wealthier, and they coordinate their efforts on an array of economic and social issues that include taxation, trade, higher education, medical treatment, the preservation of the environment, and others. The OECD presents and environment for its member nations to discuss policy situations, examine economic data, and establish standards of excellence for solving common issues. It performs study, publishes reports, and makes policy recommendations in order to support governments in establishing and carrying out efficient strategies that foster for a long-time socioeconomic development and economic growth. As a whole, the OECD has an important influence on the international governance of the economy as well as cooperation amongst the nations that are members, with a final objective of encouraging equitable and sustainable development for humanity. According to the question, I decided to choose 10 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries by several tax rates, which has been illustrated with the help of the tables below;\r\nS.N	Name of the Countries	Sales tax rate	Income Tax Rate	Corporate tax rate\r\n		Last Unit	Previous\r\nUnit	Last Unit\r\n	Previous Unit	Last Unit	Previous\r\nUnit\r\n1	Austria	20%	20%	55%	55%	23%	24%\r\n2	Belgium	21%	21%	50%	50%	25%	25%\r\n3	Denmark	25%	25%	56%	55.9%	22%	22%\r\n4	Estonia	22%	20%	20%	20%	20%	20%\r\n5	Finland	24%	24%	56.95%	56.95%	20%	20%\r\n6	France	20%	20%	45%	45%	25%	25%\r\n7	Germany	19%	19%	45%	45%	30%	30%\r\n8	Greece	24%	24%	44%	44%	22%	22%\r\n9	Iceland	24%	24%	46.25%	46.25%	20%	20%\r\n10	Italy	22%	22%	43%	43%	24%	24%\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, and sales tax rates in ten OECD countries especially Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, and Italy the rate and identification of most business-friendly country, country most favorable for employment, and the country most conducive to retirement can be examined. A business-friendly environment is characterized by favorable tax policies that encourage investments, innovations, and entrepreneurship. Among the OECD countries considered, Estonia, Finland and Iceland stand out as the most business friendly in terms of corporate tax rates. These countries maintain a low corporate tax rate of 20%, providing an attractive proposition for businesses seeking to minimize their tax burden while maximizing the profits (Trading Economics, 2024). The simplified tax system of these countries further enhances its attractiveness to businesses. This favorable tax regime has contributed to reputation of Estonia, Finland and Iceland as a hub for the startups and digital innovation, fostering economic growth and competitiveness. Among these three countries, Estonia also maintains a relatively low personal tax rate. Low personal income tax rates incentivize labor mobility, attract skilled workers, and support entrepreneurship. When considering the sales tax rates, Estonia with 20% rate is moderated compared to other OECD countries. While not the lowest (lowest Germany with 19%), Estonia still contributes to a favorable business environment by providing revenue for public services without overly burdening consumers. Estonia emerges as the most business-friendly country among the OECD nations analyzed due to its competitive corporate tax rates, moderate personal income tax rates and reasonable sales tax rates (Trasberg, 2014).\r\n High income earners seek countries with lower personal income tax rates to maximize their disposable income. By comparing the personal oncome tax rates across the 10 OECD countries, we can identify the most favorable destinations for earning more income. Among the countries analyzed, Estonia stands out with its relatively low personal income tax rate of 20%. This rate is substantially lower than those of other OECD countries such as Denmark (55.9%), Austria (55%) and Finland (56.95%) (Trading Economics, 2024). When evaluating the favorability for employment, personal income tax rates play a significant role as they directly impact take-home pay of an individual and incentivize labor mobility. Among the countries analyzed, Estonia again emerges as a favorable destination for employment due to its relatively low personal income tax rate of 20%. Other countries in this category have almost 43-55% of last and previous personal income tax rate. This competitive tax rate not only attracts the skilled workers but also encourages entrepreneurship and investment human capital. The progressive tax system of Estonia coupled with various incentives for research and development, promotes employment growth, and fosters a skilled workforce capable of driving innovation productivity.\r\nFor retirees with fixed incomes, low sales taxes and overall cost of living are crucial factors in choosing a retirement destination. Germany emerges as attractive retirement destination with 19% of sales tax rate. Low sales taxes help retirees stretch their budget further, ensuring a comfortable standard living. Additionally, Germany offers social services, health care and infrastructures to overall well-being of the retirees. Iceland and France can be also an attractive retirement destination despite of its relatively high sales tax rate of 24%. Iceland offers comprehensive social services, health care, and high standard of living, progressive income tax system ensures that retirees with lower income are not disproportionately burdened by tax (Karlsson, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n Karlsson, J.
