It highlights how the protests, which were encouraged by cases of police brutality towards black people, resulted in an enormous change in the People’s opinion of the issue of racial discrimination in society. The paper focuses on the Black activism opposing state-sanctioned violence, which includes murder and outbreaks of violence by law enforcement, which has been around for decades and is an organizing principle for the Black Lives Matter movement. In addition, the article also focuses on the role of black women in the movement by contrasting current activists to historical role models such as Fannie Lou Hamer, and Ella Baker (Francis & Wright-Rigueur, 2021). It has spotlighted the words of decentralized governance and strategies for acquiring authority. \n\n      \n\n     We chose this topic because the article provides historical perspectives and reaches into the starting point of the 20th century and the ancient origins of the Black Lives Matter movement. In addition to the movement’s present state, it focuses on prominent historical people. Also, the article portrays the significant achievements made by Black women throughout the Black Lives Matter movement and this movement facilitates an in-depth awareness of the movement and its evolution.\n\n\n\nDrakulich, K.

This article claims that it addresses why there exists a disparity in racial makeup since the absence of support among white Americans is surprising. It examines four potential reasons for racial disparities in views regarding Black Lives Matter using evidence from a nationwide survey conducted at the high point of the initial wave of the public’s understanding of the movement. These explanations carry various implications for understanding the importance of these inequalities based on race and represent constructing contrasting arguments made by both advocates and opponents of the movement (Drakulich et al., 2021). Two of the reasons focus on racial bias, while an additional two cover the views regarding the police. The outcome indicates that the racial bias in dealings with police impacted perceptions of the movement in various ways for Black and White Americans.\n\n               \n\nThe relevance and impact on the lives of many black people made us choose this topic.  Policymakers, activists, and others who are passionate about fostering more equality in society would benefit substantially from comprehending the factors that contribute to the disparity in racial makeup in Black Lives Matter support. It sheds light on the obstacles and different difficulties that racial equity movements must have to overcome. \n\n\n\n\n\nBrowning, M. C. (2022).

NLP Based Text Summarization Using Semantic Analysis  \nIntroduction  \nText Summarization is a supervised learning method, that heavily relies on Natural \nLanguage Processing (NLP), which helps in generating concise and comprehensive \nsummaries from massive number  of text -based inputs.  \nThis literature review focuses on the research paper titled “NLP Based Text \nSummarization Using Sematic Analysis” which introduces an innovative approach for \nspecific text summarization.  To save manual effort in information processing, the study \ndiscusses the challenges of summarizing large texts and highlights the use of \nautomatic summarization tools. The author offers  a method based on Semantic \nAnalysis, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps in extracting \nrepresentative sentences and generates meaningful summaries.  \nMethodology  \nThe proposed methodology in this research paper leverages  a technique based on \nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for text summarization. LSA is used to extract \nsemantically important sentences and generate a summary of the input text. First, the \ninput document undergoes data preprocessing method, where irrelevant wo rds such \nas stop, words are removed to enhance the quality of the summary. A matrix of word \ncounts is constructed from preprocessed text, representing the occurrence of words \nacross sentences. The s entence matrix undergoes Singular Value Decomposition \n(SVD) to reduce dimensionality and identify the latent semantic structure of the text. \nThis helps in identifying the most  noticeable feature of the document, enabling \nextraction of meaningful sentences for summary.  Based on latent semantic structure, \nthe system identifies the most relevant sentence and arranges them in a coherent \nmanner to generate the final summary.   6CS007  \n2 \n  \nFigure 1  Proposed System (Moiyadi, et al., 2016)  \nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used for \nidentifying the most important sentences in a text document.  Below  is the \nmathematical equation for the LSA method.   \nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD)  \nSVD is used to factorize the term -document matrix into three matrices: u, ∑, and v \nu, s, v = svds (matrix, k= num_concepts)  \nSaliency Vector Calculation  \nThe saliency of each sentence is calculated as the dot product of the squared values \nin u and v . \nsaliency_vec  = np.dot (np.square(u), np.square(v))  \nTopic Filtering  \nSingular values below a certain threshold controlled by topic_sigma_threshold are set \nto zero to filter out less significant topics.  \nu [u < sigma_threshold] = 0  \nTop Sentence Selection  \nThe top sentences are selected based on their saliency scores.  \n 6CS007  \n3 \n top_sentences = saliency_vec.argsort() [ -length:] [:: -1] \nHere, the code implements Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to perform text \nsummarization. First the input text is preprocessed,  and a term -document matrix is \ngenerated. Then SVD is applied to identify the important topics and sentences and at \nlast the salient sentences are selected to create a summary.  \nDiscussion  \nThe authors applied LSA -based summarization technique to a diverse set of texts and \nevaluated the performance of generated summaries. They measured the quality of the \nsummaries using various metrics, including ROUGE scores, F1 -score, and precision -\nrecall c urves. The study indicates that LSA approach performed better than existing \nsummarization techniques  (Moiyadi, et al., 2016) .  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  6CS007  \n4 \n 2. Survey on NLP based automatic extractive text summarization \nusing Spacy  \nIntroduction  \nThis article provides a general overview of the area of NLP-based automated text \nsummarization. It seeks to discuss and evaluate frequently used summarizing \ntechniques by the researchers with an emphasis on useful and successful tactics with \nan insight into the evolution of summarization. The major key points t hat the article \ndiscusses are the difficulties of numerically evaluating the quality of summary and the \ndistinctions between extractive and abstractive summarization.  \nThe article offers a comprehensive examination of text summarization, tracing its \nevolution from early IBM research in 1950s to modern methods. The authors delve \ninto the fundamental ideas behind extractive summarizing techniques, putting special \nemphasis on the importance of elements like key phrase recognition and sentence \npositioning during the summarization procedure. These methods  are considered as \nthe pillars that support the development of contemporary extractive summarization \napproaches.  \nNLP and Ambiguity  \nText summarization and other applications, such as language translation and chatbots, \nrely heavily on NLP, which emphasizes its importance in comprehending and \ninterpreting human language. NLP is complicated because natural language is often \nunclear and un certain. There are different types of uncertainties in language: Lexical \nambiguity; that occurs when a single word has multiple meanings. Syntactic ambiguity: \nthis occurs from the way words are structured in sentences. For instance, the phrase \n“Visiting re latives can be tedious” can have two different interpretations. Lastly, \nsemantic ambiguity: this occurs when the meaning of words themselves are unclear.  \nPhases of Natural Language Processing  \nThe article claims that the phases of NLP including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, \nsemantic analysis, discourse integration and pragmatic analysis help in analyzing \nambiguities. Lexical analysis is the first step where the sentences are divided into  \ntokens. For the second step, syntactic analysis or parsing is performed, where the \nword order is studied then in semantic analysis meaning and word order is analyzed.  6CS007  \n5 \n After performing discourse integration, pragmatic analysis is performed which is the \nlast stage, where real impact of text is gained.  \n \n \nFigure 2 Phases of Natural Language Processing (Prakash, et al., 2022) . \nPreprocessing  \nTo retrieve valid information, pre -processing steps in text summarization are depicted \nin the article including sentence separation, stop words removal, stemming, part -of \nspeech tagging and keyword extraction.  \nConclusion  \nThe authors make recommendations for potential future text summarizing research. \nThey draw attention to the fact that it can be difficult to reach consensus between \nmultiple annotators and that we need more effective tools to automatically verify text \nsumm aries. This demonstrates how the industry is developing and working towards \nmore effective automatic text summarization systems (Prakash, et al., 2022) . \n \n \n \n \n 6CS007  \n6 \n 3. Implementation of NLP based on automatic text summarization \nusing spacy  \nSummarization of large texts has become a pivotal task in natural language processing \n(NLP) and has garnered significant attention in both academic research and \ncommercial applications. In recent years, the field of text summarization has witnessed \nsignifi cant advancements, driven by the integration of deep learning models and NLP \ntechniques. This article explores the state of the art in automatic text summarization, \nwith a focus on summarization techniques, challenges,  and the role of libraires like \nSpaCy.  With the two different methods of summarization i.e., extractive,  and \nabstractive summarization. A method utilizing K -Means clustering for sentence \nselection in extractive method was introduced which involves in preprocessing the \ninput text by removing the stop words, hyphens, and extra spaces followed by n -grams \nto sel ect the features and applying clustering techniques .  \nSummarization Techniques  \nAn unsupervised framework called SummCoder for extractive summarization was \nintroduced that employs a scoring system, considering sentence content relevance, \nsentence novelty, and sentence position relevance, to select sentences for the \nsummary . A graph -based  extraction system was introduced in the paper that utilizes \nthe nouns as nodes and non -nouns words as edge. This approach considers the \nrelationship between nouns and selects  the sentences based on prominence of nouns, \nachieving effective sentence extr action.   \nThe paper also suggests that abstractive summarization methods are more \nchallenging but hold the promise of creating more human -like summaries. Zheng and \nLapata proposed PacSumm, which employs a graph -based rank algorithm and utilizes \nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) for representation \nmapping which leverages transformer -based model to create abstractive summaries \nby considering the relationships between sentences.  \nSpacy in Text Summarization  \nThe automatic text summarization with the above techniques faced challenges \nparticularly with abstractive summarization. However, the recent advancements in \ndeep learning have  improved. SpaCy is an open -source NLP library in Python, that \nplays a significant role in text summarization and sentence extraction. It offers a range  6CS007  \n7 \n of NLP functionalities, including tokenization, part -of-speech tagging, parsing, and \nnamed entity recognition. These features are essential for the preprocessing and \nunderstanding the structure of the input text. It supports deep learning workflows with \nmodels compatible with PyTorch and TensoFlow. It provides accurate parsing, \nsentence boundary detection and access to the word vectors making it a valuable tool \nfor researchers and developers working on text summari zation projects.  \nDiscussion  \nThe text summarization process in this article follows several key steps. The initial \nphase involves preparing the input text for the summarization. This addresses the \nissues commonly found in unstructured text, such as line breaks, special characters, \nunwanted spaces, and punctuation. Then, the stop words are removed which are the \nwords which contribute little meaning are eliminated. After the removal of stop words, \ntokenization is performed which splits the sentences into individual words, forming \ntokens.  Then the selection and extraction of significant sentences from the \npreprocessed text is performed . This step involves frequency analysis, weight \ncalculation of each word determined by dividing frequency by maximum frequency. \nKey phrases in the input text are reviewed and sentences are scored by summing \nweighted frequencies of word then the token list is sorted in descending order based \non scores. The sentences with the highest  score are selected for inclusion in the final  \nsummary.  This method is further i ntegrated with NLP frameworks  using libraries like \nSpaCy which enables efficient extraction of informative summaries  (Nayana, et al., \n2022) . \n \nFigure 3 Architecture for text summarization using SpaCy  (Nayana, et al., 2022)  \n \n 6CS007  \n8 \n 4. Automatic Text Summarization Using Gensim Word2Vec and K -\nMeans Clustering Algorithm  \nIntroduction  \nThis paper gives us two necessary approaches for text summarization which are \nextractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive involves choosing relevant \nsentences, paragraphs, or phrases directly from the source and then summarizing it. \nOn the other hand, abstractive creates  new sentences by rephrasing the original text \nusing words that are not in the source document.  The primary objective of this research \nis to summarize single documents using a sentence -based model with clustering. The \nstudy leverage s Gensim Word2Vec for feature extraction, aiming to identify the main  \nconcept  across the sentence s. \nThe model proposed by this paper is primarily a sentence -based clustering approach \nfor summarizing news articles. The BBC news article dataset consisting of 2,225 news \narticles  were categorized into five groups (business, entertainment, politics, sport, and \ntech) which were used for the research. To prepare the data for analysis, sentences \nwere first tokenized where text was divided into sentences using NLTK library. \nUnnecessary characters were removed, commonly occurring stop words were \neliminated, duplica te words within each sentence were removed retaining only one \ninstance and then words in the text were lemmatized to obtain their root forms.  \nWord2Vec  \nWord2Vec, a widely used word embedding technique in neural networks, was \nemployed. Word2Vec method involves two terms: Skip Gram and Common Bag of \nWords (CBOW). For the implementation method, Skip Gram was chosen due to its \neffectiveness with small data amounts and uncommon words. CBOW takes meaning  \nof each word from the file and tires to predict the target word using single context input. \nThis technique generated vector representations for each word, with similar words \nhaving closer spatial positions  (Karani, 2018) .  \nsin(𝑋,𝑌)= cos(𝜃)=(𝑋.𝑌)\n||𝑋|| ||𝑌|| \n  6CS007  \n9 \n Gensim Word2Vec  \nAnother open -source library for unsupervised learning is Gensim, which uses \nWord2Vec to create word vectors from tokenized word lists based on Latent Dirichlet \nAllocation (LDA).  \nK-Means Clust ering \nData points with comparable characteristics were grouped into groups using K -Means \nclustering. K -Means seeks to reduce the squared distance between each data point \nand the cluster center.  Below  is an a lgorithmic representation of K -Means . \nLet M = {m1, m2, m 3,….,mn} be collection of data points and V = {v1, v2, v3, ..., vc} \nare the centers.  \n1. A cluster of the center named c was chosen at random.  \n2. The distinction between a cluster center and a single data point is established.  \n3. Cluster center datapoints are assigned to cluster centers within the shortest travel \ntime.  \n4. The following factors are used to identify the new center of cluster:  \n𝑣𝑖=(1)\n(𝑐𝑖)∑𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑖\n𝑗=1 \n5. New cluster centers are found by recalculating the distance between each data \npoint.  \n6. If there is no reallocated data point, step 3 is repeated. (Ortega, et al., 2009) . \nElbow Method to find k  \nThe ideal value of k, which stands for the number of clusters used in the model, was \nfound using the elbow approach. The final step involved generating the summary. The \ncluster with the highest number of sentences, indicating the most valuable sentences, \nwas selected.  \nThe steps to follow elbow method . \n1. The range of K is 1 to 9.  \n2. Here, the value of k is  Increased  by 1.   6CS007  \n10 \n Third, calculate the distortion.  \n4. The point at which the distortion starts to linearly decrease.  \n \nFigure 4 The elbow with k =2 in business_doc_465  (Haider, et al., 2020)  \nEvaluation  \nThe Word2Vec model was used to calculate the mean similarity of the sentences \ninside the cluster while taking noun and number content into account. The sentences \nwere chosen to produce a summary of the original text that was one -third as long. Two \ntexts have been compared using the BELU score. The score for each category of the \nnews article in the image below, from lowest to highest, is calculated using BELU. The \nmodel for the business article outperformed the others. For business items, the highest \nBELU score was 0.894  (Haider, et al., 2020) .  \n \nFigure 5 BELU Score for business article  (Haider, et al., 2020)  \n 6CS007  \n11 \n  \nFigure 6 Summary score comparison between news article categories  (Haider, et al., 2020)  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6CS007  \n12 \n 5. Speed Reading Tool Powered by Artificial Intelligence for \nStudents with ADHD, Dyslexia, or Short Attention Span   \nThe paper  reveals that the development of AI -based solutions to improve reading \ncomprehension and speed among the people with ADHD  (Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder) or  dyslexia has represented great advancement in the sector  \nof education and accessibility.  Although there have been traditional speed -reading  \nmethods,  they frequently need substantial training and practice. However,  many \nresearches  and developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural \nLanguage Processing (NLP) have paved a way for the development of AI powered \nspeed -reading  tools that can automatically summarize the texts facilitating efficient \ninformation intake.   \nT5 Model  \nThe proposed model discussed in this paper uses a pre -trained model to generate \nsummaries of the input text. The tool includes features such as custom bolding feature, \nhighlighting the important information and feature to adjust the line, word and character \nspacing in the tool for custom reading preference. The pretrained model used by this \ntool is T5 (Text -to-Text Transfer Transformer) provided by Transformers library, a \nmodel from Hugging Face.  The model was further fine -tuned to allow generate \naccurate a nd personalized summaries  (Raffel, et al., 2020) .  \nTransfor mer Architecture  \nThe transformer architecture was introduced by Va swani and their colleague in their \ngroundbreaking paper named “Attention is All You Need” in 2017 that has \nrevolutionized use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its tasks  (Vaswani, et \nal., 2017) . The core concept of this architecture lies in self-attention, often referred to \nas scaled dot -product attention, enabling the model to weigh the importance of the \ndifferent words in a sequence when processing specific words.  \nFeedforward Neural Networks (F FNNs)  \nThe transformer architecture is incorporated with Feedforward Neural Networks that \nplays a pivotal role in the processing and generating expressive representations . The \nencoder and decoder layers of the Transformer compute  the attention score for each \ntoken in the data entered which is the input sequence . The outputs from the self -\nattention layer are channeled through FFNNs which consists of two linear  6CS007  \n13 \n transformations, which is often followed by a non -linear activation function such as \nRectified Linear Unit (ReLU), introducing non -linearity and enabling complex pattern \nand relationship learning within the data.  \nTool Implementation  \nIn implementing AI -based speed -reading  tool, T5 tokenizer is set to “t5-base” which \nhandles the sequences with a maximum of 512 tokens  and T5 model is loaded with \n“t5-base” for summarization. To manage long paragraphs , the text is divided into \nsmaller 512 -token chunks, ensuring the summarization process retains  important \ninformation.  The system uses Flask as the development framework, which is a \nlightweight web server framework to handle user input, process the text and apply the \nalgorithms from the python script. For the interface the proposed tool uses HTML, \nCSS,  and JavaScript to display the summarized information.  The below figure is a \nscreenshot of the user interface of the summarizing tool  (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023) . \n \nFigure 7 Summarizing user interface  (Kamarozaman, et al., 2023)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6CS007  \n14 \n 6. Hybrid Long Document Summarization using C2F -FAR and \nChatGPT: A Practical Study   \nLong Document  summarization has drawn a lot of attention nowadays in the field of \ninformation retri eval. The development of cutting -edge language models like C2F -FAR \nand ChatGPT has created new opportunities for exploring the real -world uses of hybrid \nsummarization pipelines.  This paper gives significant  research initiatives and \nadvancements in lengthy document summarization and focuses on the advantages \nand difficulties of the hybrid approaches used in this paper.  \nDue to the extensive amount of information and the need  for consistency and integrity \nin the summaries, long documents have issues while summarizing  because of large \namount of information and the need of coherence summaries. Traditional extractive \nmethods tend to struggle with generating coherent and concise summaries.  Large \nlanguage models like ChatGPT enable abstractive approaches addressing the \nchallenges but also have problems with content hallucination and stylistic \ninconsistencies.  \nC2F-FAR \nIn this paper, C2F -FAR (Content -to-flow Extractive Facilitated Abstractive \nsummarization) was introduced that offers an extractive summarization approach for \nlong documents. It relies on sentence extraction to identify key information, aiming to \nenhance the summaries. The study shows that C2F -FAR can generate summaries \nwith competitive automated metrics, indicating its potential as a basis for hybrid \nsummarization.  It can automatically select sentences  from a document by considering \nthe semantics similarity  between blocks of text and between different sentences.  The \nbelow figure illustrates the application of default C2F -FAR settings to 20 cleaned \narticles, demonstrating that the number of blocks partitions generally increases with \nthe number of sentences in an article  which shows that the model can automatically \ncapture semantic blocks in text.  \n  6CS007  \n15 \n  \nFigure 8 Testing C2F -FAR default settings on 20 articles  (Lu, et al., 2023).  \n \nChatGPT  \nThe research also focused on utilizing ChatGPT for summarization, specifically in the \ncontext of extractive summaries generated by C2F -FAR with a particular emphasis on \nlong documents. The summarization process involved in the two -step prompting \nmethod gen erally yielded satisfactory summary length compared to human written \nsummaries. However, repeated requests  for additional details led to irrelevancy.  These \nsummarizations  were performed based on GPT -3.5, except for  the final  test using \nGPT-4 for summarizin g the entire  book.  \nEvaluation  \nFor the evaluation, automated metrics such as ROGUE and BERT Score were used \nwhich suggested that machine -generated summaries are equivalent with the human \nwritten ones.  The evaluation of summarization pipeline involved both human and \nautomated metrics.  Human evaluations reveal critical issues related to coherence, \nfaithfulness, and style. The below figure shows the paraphrasing ability of ChatGPT \nagainst C2F -FAR extracted sentences using 20 cleaned articles.  \n \nFigure 9 Evaluation of article summarizes with various metrics  (Lu, et al., 2023).  \n 6CS007  \n16 \n In the figure above, when ChatGPT paraphrases sentences extracted by C2F -FAR, it \nleads to slightly lower ROGUE -1 and BALANC scores,  but a slightly higher BERT \nScore compared to C2F -FAR generated summaries. ROGUE -2 and ROGUE -L scores \nremain largely unchanged. However, paraphrasing introduces new words to convey \nthe same meaning resulting in higher ESTIME alarms and lower ESTIME soft va lues \ncompared to C2F -FAR generated summaries. Despite this, ChatGPT’s ESTIME \nalarms value remains lower than human written su mmaries and ESTIME soft value \nremains higher. In conclusion, ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to rewrite text to \nsome extent while maintaining overall summary quality  (Lu, et al., 2023) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  6CS007  \n17 \n Bibliography  \nHaider, M.

What existing NLP algorithms and approaches will be used to automate the \ntext summarization?  \nIV. What tech niques will be used to handle document parsing and processing \nfor document format (e.g., PDF)?  \n2. Aims and Objectives  \n2.1. Aims  \nI. To d evelop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based document \nsummarization model.  \nII. To create a tool for summarizing lengthy documents, r esearch papers, and \narticles.  \nIII. To p rovide the users with concise summaries for improved content \ncomprehension.  \nIV. To improve efficiency in learning and reading contents.  \nV. To save time and increase interest  in reading document -based  contents.  6CS007  \n2 \n 2.2. Objectives  \nI. A web application will be created that will allow users to input documents \nand get summaries generated.  \nII. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy technology will be used to \nhandle document parsing and processing for various formats.  \nIII. A suitable Natural Language Pr ocessing (NLP) summarization model will be \nchosen . \nIV. The summarized set of documents will then be stored in the database from \nthe documents.  \n \n3. Problem Statement  \nDue to the expansion in digital information, a challenge of information overloading has \nbeen seen . Dealing with lengthy documents and research materials becomes time \nconsuming, hindering the ability to extract crucial information quickly.  A study \npublished in Nature Communication reveals that our collective attention span is \nnarrowing. This is not just  on social media but also in different domains , that people \nare losing their attention span  (Lorenz -Spreen, et al., 2019) . Due to the low attention \nspan, most individuals are not likely to read journals, books, and other docume nted \nfiles. The rise of audio -visual content has also impacted the consumption of text -based \ninformation. These days the way of consuming information has changed which is a \npositive thing but in context of a person with academic background in performing \nresearch based on text -based documents,  one of the pain -points I have been facing  \nis analyzing and curating the contents from lengthy documents . In the professional  \nworld, handling and extracting major key points  from proposals  and documents could \nbe a terrible task for working individuals until there is a summarization tool that makes \nthe task easier.  \n \n \n 6CS007  \n3 \n 4. Project as Solution  \nProfessionals, researchers, and students face challenges of extracting content from \nresearch papers and journals. This summarization tool will extract important insights \nfrom a paper to make informed decisions quickly.  Dealing with lengthy documents that \nrequire significant time and effort is a terrible task, the project will be able to minimize \nthe time  required and will prioritize important documents. This  tool will help streamline \nthe process of summarizing and aggregating information from multiple sources and \nwill store it for further usage of the user.  People will be able to access necessary \ncontent  in a short format,  saving time.  It will encourage continuous learning by allowing \nusers to explore a broader range of topics within a shorter time frame.  \n5. Scope and Limitations  \n5.1. Scope  \nI. The major scope of this application is that it can summarize pdf-based  \ndocuments including research papers, articles, and textual content.  \nII. It will be able to identify key points, findings, and contextual information from \nlengthy documents.  \n5.2. Limitations  \nI. Summarization algorithms may not capture the complete context of a \ndocument . \nII. The tool will be limited to cross -language summarization  feature.  \nIII. The tool focuses on text -based documents and may not be able to \neffectively handle images, charts, and videos.  \nIV. The summarizer might be limited to certain word count.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 6CS007  \n4 \n 6. Initial Research  \n6.1. Hugging Face  \nHugging Face is a platform for data science and machine learning which was initially \ndeveloped in 2017 as a chatbot app for teenagers but has expanded its domain from \njust a chatbot app. This platform has a range of functionalities from creati ng, hosting, \nand managing their own AI models to engaging in discussions and collaborations \nwithin the platform. Hugging face also holds a substantial collection of models and \ndatasets created by the collaborators and users. This platform encompasses a ran ge \nof AI applications like computer vision, audio analysis, and natural language \nprocessing  (Rebelo, 2023) . \n6.2. Natural Language Processing  (NLP)  \nNatural Language Processing  (NLP)  is a division  of AI that aims to make computers \ncomprehend , analyze,  and produce human language. NLP plays and significant role \nin extracting  the most meaningful information. NLP encompasses various techniques \nand methods to process and understand human language. The d ivision of NLP \napproaches  extractive and abstractive summarization, along with other categories \nsuch as single -document, multi -document, and query -based  summarization.  \n6.2.1.  Abstractive Summarization  \nAbstractive summarization is a method where the generated summary doesn’t \nnecessarily consist of sentences present in the original text, instead it creates new \nsentences that capture the key concepts. This is a approach where the new texts are \ngenerated on ly after  abstracting and  understanding the semantic meaning of the text \nwhile captur ing the key concepts of  the original content.  \n6.2.2.  Extractive Summarization  \nSimilarly, Extractive summarization involves  choosing sentences directly from the \nsource text to cre ate a concise summar ization . Then the  chosen text based content is \ntypically chosen based on its importance and relevance. This method aims to retain \nthe original wording from the text, making it more conservative approach to \nsummarization (Adhikari, et al., 2020) .  \n \n 6CS007  \n5 \n 7. Literature Review  \n7.1. NLP Based Text Summarization Using Semantic Analysis \n(Moiyadi, et al., 2016)  \n7.1.1.  Introduction  \nText Summarization is a supervised learning method that heavily relies on Natural \nLanguage Processing (NLP), which helps in generating concise and comprehensive \nsummaries from a massive number of text -based inputs.  \nThis literature review focuses on the re search paper titled “NLP Based Text \nSummarization Using Semantic Analysis” which introduces an innovative approach for \nspecific text summarization. To save manual effort in information processing, the study \ndiscusses the challenges of summarizing large tex ts and highlights the use of \nautomatic summarization tools. The author offers a method based on Semantic \nAnalysis, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps in extracting \nrepresentative sentences and generates meaningful summaries.  \n7.1.2.  Methodo logy  \nThe proposed methodology in this research paper leverages a technique based on \nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for  summarizing text -based data . LSA is used to \nextract semantically important sentences and generate the summary of the input text. \nFirstly, the input document undergoes a data preprocessing method, where irrelevant \nwords such as stop,  words are removed to enhance the quality of the summary. A \nmatrix of word counts is constructed from preprocessed text, representing the \noccurrence of words ac ross sentences. The sentence matrix undergoes Singular \nValue Decomposition (SVD) to reduce dimensionality and identify the latent semantic \nstructure of the text. This helps in identifying the most noticeable feature of the \ndocument, enabling extraction of meaningful sentences for summary. Based on latent \nsemantic structure, the system identifies the most relevant sentence and arranges \nthem in a coherent manner to generate the final summary.  6CS007  \n6 \n  \nFigure 1 Proposed System (Moiyadi, et al ., 2016)  \n7.1.3.  Conclusion  \nThe authors applied LSA -based summarization techniques to a diverse set of texts \nand evaluated the performance of generated summaries. They measured the quality \nof the summaries using various metrics, including ROUGE scores, F1 -score, a nd \nprecision -recall curves. The study indicates that the LSA approach performed better \nthan existing summarization techniques.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6CS007  \n7 \n 8. Functional Decomposition Diagram  \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Functional Decomposition Diagram of the system  \n \n \n9. Artifacts  \nThe proposed artifacts outline the components and features for document to text \nsummarization  system. The system comprises different subsystems , each with \nspecific functionalities.  \n9.1. Frontend Subsystem  \n9.1.1.  User Registration  \nThis will be the first user interaction, which will allow the user to register by creating a \nuser account and login with their credentials. Here, the user needs to provide their \nbasic information to access the system.  \n9.1.2.  Document Upload  \nUsers can interact with the system by uploading documents they wish to summarize. \nThis feature provides users to i nput the documents  into the system.  \n9.1.3.  Summary Display  \nAfter the document is uploaded , this feature will play an important role in  displaying \nthe summarized data to the user.  \n6CS007  \n8 \n 9.2. NLP Subsystem  \n9.2.1.  API Based Summarizer  \nThis functionality will integrate an external summarization API from hugging face or \nany reliable source which will allow summarizing any kind of documents.  \n9.2.2.  Custom Summarizer  \nThis system will be trained with custom  data especially for a specific kind of text-based  \nfile such as book and will summarize the contents based on its specific feature.  \n9.3. Backend  Subsystem  \n9.3.1.  Database Management  \nThe system will use MariaDB to manag e data storage and will be storing user \ninformation, uploaded documents and generated summaries allowing the users to \naccess and review the summaries of their uploaded documents whenever they need.  \n9.3.2.  API Management  \nThis functionality will be involved in man aging the data fetched from the API and will \nbe helping in allowing the external summarization API.   \n10. Software Development Methodology  \nTo organize the software development cycle, Kanban Methodology will be used. \nKanban is a method used to manage and optimi ze workflows in project management \nby emphasizing visual work, limiting work in progress, and promoting continuous \nimprovement. Choosing Kanban for individual software development offers distinct \nadvantages over other SDLC methodologies. Kanban allows high  flexibility as it deals \nwith prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency since solo developers \noften face quick change in priority. It encourages a constant flow of deliverables \nleading to quicker feedback. It allows individual developers to manage their work in a \nway that suits their own pace and style, as it does not have a predefined iteration like \nScrum, allowing them not to spend time on detailed planning sessions or assigning \ntasks (Raut, 2015).  \n \n \n 6CS007  \n9 \n  \nFigure 3 A glimpse to Trello  \nTrello will be utilized to follow the Kanban method, utilizing its visual card -based \nsystem for effective task and project management. Trello was launched in 2011, \nattributed to user friendly design and adaptabi lity which helped it in gaining popularity. \nIn Trello, the tasks are visualized  as cards or sticky notes on a visual board  which is \nkanban and , usually divided into columns that represent different stages of the \nworkflow, such as ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’ and  ‘Done’. These cards are movable across \nthe columns to reflect the progress of the work  (Johnson, 2021) .  \n \n \n6CS007  \n10 \n 11. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  \n \nFigure 4 Work Breakdown Structure  \n \n \n12. Gantt Chart  \nBelow  is a proposed Gantt Chart of the overall timeline of the project. Here the project \ntimeline is divided into six phases. The first phase is the phase of project initiation \nwhere the requirement gathering, research and proposal is prepared for the project. \nBased on the first phase the second phase starts with the basic visualization of the \noverall system through wireframing and creating the User Interface (UI) and User \nExperience (UX) of the system. After this, the phase of development kicks off with the \nintegration of API in a crude system without a frontend. The evaluation of the API \nsystem will be conducted and then the NLP model will be developed which includes \nthe preprocessing, model architecture design, model training, and fine tuning of  the \nsystem. Th e model will then  be displayed after the front-end development and the \nbackend development will help in setting up the backend with database integration. \nFinally , a final documentation of the whole project will be done  accordingly as shown \nin the Gantt Chart below.  \n6CS007  \n11 \n  \nFigure 5 Gant t Chart  \n \n \n13. Tools and Technology  \n13.1.  HTML/ CSS/ JS  \nHTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for front-end development for this system, where \nHTML  helps in structuring the content where CSS helps in defining the visual \nrepresentation of the HTML  elements, ensuring a co nsistent and attractive design. \nSimilarly, JavaScript  helps in adding interactivity , enabling dynamic content updates \nand enhancing the user engagement.  \n13.2.  Django Framework  \nDjango Framework was chosen  for backend due to my familiarity with Python \nlanguage. D jango is known for its effectiveness in handling web applications. It is a \nfree and open -source web framework for Python that accelerates the development of \nweb applications. It offers a more effective method  to build and develop web programs \nthat initiati ng from scratch because it removes the need to build the backend, APIs, \nJavaScript  (IBM, 2023) .  \n6CS007  \n12 \n 13.3.  MariaDB  \nTo store the data, MariaDB will be used due to its user -friendly interface simplifies \ndatabase management, making it an excellent choice for an uncomplicated database \nsolution.  \n13.4.  NLP Model  \nNLP model is the proposed model that will be used for the machine learning aspect of \nthe system. TextRank is one of the algorithms  that extracts important  sentences from \na document. Similarly for the proposed system,  transformer -based  models such as \nBERT a nd BART could be used for abstractive summarization  (Pietro, 2022) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6CS007  \n13 \n Bibliography  \nAdhikari, S., M. & R., 2020.
